Inspired by [Derek Sivers now page](http://sivers.org/now), here’s what I am doing right now (last update June 2017):

* Enjoying family life.
* [Working as a freelancer, helping my clients improve their Data with AI and Java](http://peated.be/).
* [Reading](https://www.goodreads.com/user/show/37577599-peter-backx). Among others, [the entire Dune saga](http://www.dunenovels.com/). Next up is Children of Dune.
* Printing and designing things for [my Etsy shop](https://www.etsy.com/shop/Printin3DBE).
* Moving my site from WPEngine to Github Pages.
* Rewatching Futurama.

What I’m not doing right now:

* [Slowly winding down my side business, making sure my customers can find a good new home for their bookkeeping](http://www.streamhead.com/launching-my-first-vaadin-appengine-project/).
* [Printing and assembling a robot](http://wirebeings.com/). The basic functions are working. Now I'd like to add a gyro and distance sensor to have it automap it's surroundings. But the project lost a bit of steam and is on hold for now.
* Working [on](http://amzn.to/1XpS4Vz) various [smaller](https://www.discogsscan.com) side projects (only 2 left, I started with 7 two years ago).
