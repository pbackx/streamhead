Inspired by [Derek Sivers now page](http://sivers.org/now), here&#8217;s what I am doing right now (last update June 2017):

  * Enjoying family life.
  * [Working as a freelancer, helping my clients improve their Data with AI and Java](http://peated.be/).
  * [Reading](https://www.goodreads.com/user/show/37577599-peter-backx). Among others, [the entire Dune saga](http://www.dunenovels.com/). Next up is Children of Dune.
  * Printing and designing things for [my revamped Etsy shop (currently closed, relaunch somewhere in January)](https://www.etsy.com/shop/Printin3DBE).
  * [Printing and assembling a robot](http://wirebeings.com/). The basic functions are working. I&#8217;m now adding extra sensors so that the robot can map its surroundings.
  * Rewatching Twin Peaks.

What I&#8217;m not doing right now:

  * [Slowly winding down my side business, making sure my customers can find a good new home for their bookkeeping](http://www.streamhead.com/launching-my-first-vaadin-appengine-project/).
  * Working [on](http://amzn.to/1XpS4Vz) various [smaller](https://www.discogsscan.com) side projects (only 2 left, I started with 7 two years ago).
