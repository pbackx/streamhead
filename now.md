Inspired by [Derek Sivers now page](http://sivers.org/now), here’s what I am doing right now (last update June 2017):

* Enjoying family life.
* [Working as a freelancer, helping my clients improve their Data with AI and Java](http://peated.be/).
* After two years trying out various things, [I'm finally starting a new project](https://www.buildastockportfolio.com/)!
* [Reading](https://www.goodreads.com/user/show/37577599-peter-backx). Among others, [the entire Dune saga](http://www.dunenovels.com/). Next up is Heretics of Dune.
* Organizing my music collection using the awesome [Beets](http://beets.io/).
* Rewatching [Lost](https://lostpedia.fandom.com/wiki/Main_Page). The first season is still awesome, can't wait to see what I think of the later seasons.

What I’m not doing right now:

* [Slowly winding down my side business, making sure my customers can find a good new home for their bookkeeping](http://www.streamhead.com/launching-my-first-vaadin-appengine-project/). It SaaS part of the site will officially close on December 31th 2019.
* Building a [voice-controlled](https://aiyprojects.withgoogle.com/voice/) robot. I switched from printing it entirely myself, to buying a flexible chassis.
* I halted my Etsy shop. I may write about it someday, but in short, shipping stuff internationally is much more complicated than you would think.
* Working [on](http://amzn.to/1XpS4Vz) various [smaller](https://www.discogsscan.com) side projects (only 2 left).
