Do you love SimCity 4? Have you been playing it forever? Are you ready for the next step?

**Learn to change SimCity 4 to your liking.**

Over the years since SimCity 4 was released, Maxis (the creator) has released a number of tools to customize the game. Many enthusiasts have also been hard at work, reverse engineering and figuring out how all the files work together.

Now all this knowledge is at your fingertips. **You can change anything in the game. The world is your oyster**. The Internet is full of technical articles explaining you how to adapt the various parts of the game to your liking. However, they are hidden in between many useless articles and the beginner tutorials are even harder to find.

That is why Streamhead has created **the definitive introductory guide to SimCity 4 modding**.

It’s all in here! You&#8217;ll learn:

  * How to install various mods.
  * A few of the best mods to get a feel for what’s out there.
  * What you can change in the game (hint: pretty much everything)
  * How to install and use the best tools available:
  * **The official Maxis tools**: create your own buildings.
  * **SC4 Tool**: a complete building database and advanced editor.
  * **Network Addon Mod**: creating road infrastructure without limitations.
  * **iLive’s Reader**: edit virtually everything.

  * Where to find the best resources to continue your quest.
  * And more.

For only $10 you can be the creator of your own world!

**No spending hours wading through endless Internet forums, just the information you need.**

## Questions and answers

### Is this book for me?

It depends. Have you played the game for days on end? Have you tried recreating a real city? Do you like to tinker with the internals of games? Those are all good signs you are ready for the next step. Modding games isn’t always easy, but it’s extremely rewarding.

### Will it work for me?

For many of the tools you&#8217;ll need **a Windows version of Sim City 4 Deluxe or Rush Hour**. The Steam version is just fine! Most of the tools have been around for at least a few years, so most of the issues have been dealt with and they have been well-tested by numerous modders.

### What if I&#8217;m stuck?

In spite of its age, the Sim City 4 community is still alive and kicking. If you want to go beyond what&#8217;s in the report, you&#8217;ll find an incredibly welcoming community that&#8217;s ready to help you on your way. We also offer support by e-mail for anything in the book.
