If you want to get started with **ActionScript 3.0** (AS3) and create your own Flash applications, you _could_ buy all the Adobe tools you need. You&#8217;d be out of a lot of money and still don&#8217;t know ActionScript. There&#8217;s another option. It&#8217;s called **FlashDevelop**. It requires a little more attention to get started, but it is entirely free and you&#8217;ll learn a lot more about the ActionScript ins and outs.

On Streamhead, I&#8217;ve been writing a number of FlashDevelop and ActionScript 3.0 tutorials and tips. Here are the best:

## Working with Images in ActionScript

<a title="Embedding images in FlashDevelop for ActionScript 3.0" href="http://www.streamhead.com/embedding-images/" target="_blank">Embedding images in FlashDevelop</a> is an easy trick, but it is essential if you want to use FlashDevelop. <a title="Embedding images in FlashDevelop for ActionScript 3.0" href="http://www.streamhead.com/how-to-use-images-in-actionscript-3-with-flashdevelop-and-some-other-as3-tips/" target="_blank">This older post has some more tips on using and embedding images in ActionScript with FlashDevelop</a>.

One of ActionScript&#8217;s strong points is the ease with which it can deal with vector graphics. This allows you to create infinitely resizable applications. It doesn&#8217;t matter if the user is looking at your site on a smartphone or on a giant multi-monitor setup. To get started, you just need to know about the SVG format. Check out my <a title="Vector graphics in flashdevelop. SVG in Flash" href="http://www.streamhead.com/how-to-use-vector-graphics-in-flashdevelop-svg-in-flash/" target="_blank">SVG howto</a> and <a title="side-by-side comparison of png bitmaps with svg vector graphics" href="http://www.streamhead.com/vector-vs-bitmap-side-by-side-svg-png-in-flash/" target="_blank">my bitmap versus SVG comparison</a>.

<a title="ActionScript 3.0 image masking" href="http://www.streamhead.com/tutorial-applying-manipulating-mask-actionscript-3/" target="_blank">Masking images</a> is a nice and easy trick that can lead to some interesting results.

## 3D in Flash

If you want to create 3 dimensional images and animations on the web, Flash is certainly the way to go (for now?). There are quite a few ActionScript libraries out there that help you with 3D. I personally like Sandy3D. <a title="Sandy3D and FlashDevelop tutorial" href="http://www.streamhead.com/tutorial-getting-started-with-sandy-3d-and-flashdevelop/" target="_blank">Here is a tutorial on using it in conjunction with FlashDevelop</a>. <a title="Sandy 3D tutorial in FlashDevelop" href="http://www.streamhead.com/sandy-3d-tutorial/" target="_blank">And another one with a little more substance</a>.

If you want to let the user interact, there are a few hurdles to jump. There are many ways you can let the user select things, <a title="Mouse input in Sandy3D part 1" href="http://www.streamhead.com/the-secret-of-reading-mouse-input-in-flash-sandy3d-part-1/" target="_blank">this 2 part series</a> <a title="Mouse input in Sandy3D part 2" href="http://www.streamhead.com/the-secret-of-reading-mouse-input-in-flash-sandy3d-part-2/" target="_blank">shows one way</a>.

And if you want to get really fancy, <a title="Flash Physics" href="http://www.streamhead.com/obsession-flash-physics-3d/" target="_blank">a physics engine is the way to go</a>.

## Multimedia User Interfaces and Flash

Flash and ActionScript make it incredibly easy to use any type of multimedia. For instance, <a title="Scaling flash content and displaying it fullscreen" href="http://www.streamhead.com/flash-developer-flashdisplaystagescalemode/" target="_blank">you can run Flash full screen from the browser</a> which is great if you want to capture the users attention.

When you got that going, you can <a title="Stream Flash Video" href="http://www.streamhead.com/lazy-actionscript-developers-stream-flash-video/" target="_blank">stream Flash movies, with very few lines of code</a>.

If you&#8217;d like to add a user interface that isn&#8217;t too heavy on the eyes and processor, I strongly recommend <a title="Minimal Components in FlashDevelop" href="http://www.streamhead.com/minimal-components/" target="_blank">the Minimal Components library</a>.

And if that isn&#8217;t enough, why not <a title="Flash and ActionScript Game Engines" href="http://www.streamhead.com/flash-actionscript-game-engines/" target="_blank">try your hand at a game</a>?
