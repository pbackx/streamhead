Do you like to dig through other people&#8217;s closets? Come on, I know you do. Nothing is more fun than discovering a new and until-then unknown fact about a good friend. &#8220;Hey, I didn&#8217;t know you were into <a title="Electronics for model railroads" href="http://www.trainelectronics.com/MorseCode/index.htm" target="_blank">model trains</a>.&#8221; Or to try and guess the history of some one who&#8217;s yet to become a friend.

Here&#8217;s you chance to dig through my memories, my current interests, and my future plans. I have created <a title="Streamhead store" href="http://astore.amazon.co.uk/watje-21/" target="_blank">an Amazon store</a>, with a carefully selected bunch of products. Although it might seem a bit random at first, I really did put some time in it and I&#8217;m quite happy with the way it turned out. I&#8217;ve selected things I own, I used to own and stuff that&#8217;s still on my wishlist.

I sorted the products by subject, by feeling or by anything that I could think of. I plan on adding a bunch of other categories and always only keep 9 objects in each category. This way everything should remain manageable and I still have the possibility to expand. I tend to change the way I categorize my collection of stuff when I&#8217;m halfway through categorizing it, so this will suite me <a title="High Fidelity, the perfect mixtape isn't easy" href="http://www.imdb.com/title/tt0146882/" target="_blank">just fine</a>.

Let me know what you think and do not forget to share <a title="record sleeve collection" href="http://crossedcombs.typepad.com/recordenvelope/" target="_blank">your collection of</a> stuff.
