In this post, a summary of some of the most interesting posts that have appeared on this blog related to **Java**. There&#8217;s a bit for everyone, there&#8217;s some **Maven** and **Android**, as some good documentation resources. And something about **Java applets**, because, for some odd reason, I still like them.

<!--more-->Over the last few days, Streamhead has seen a major influx of new readers. I hereby welcome you all. There is something for every one here. Because many of you are new, I thought it might be nice to show you some of, what I consider, to be my best and most valuable posts. So you can get an idea of what you&#8217;ve missed and catch up. I&#8217;m going to do this at most once every month or two and I&#8217;ll be trying to make these posts thematic. This time, it&#8217;s all 

**Java**.

## Automation

Most recently, I&#8217;ve been obsessed with **automation**. Especially automated **dependency management** is a pet-peeve of mine. Most Java programs are constructed from many external libraries and those libraries in many cases also need libraries. It quickly becomes a hassle to manage this by hand.

In this regard, **Maven** is sort of a one-stop-shop for most Java programs. It&#8217;s most known feature is dependency management, but it can do so much more. A well configure Maven project can be fully automatically build, tested and deployed.

Two posts are of special interest here:

  1. <a title="Maven, Spring, Vaadin and AppEngine, all working together" href="http://www.streamhead.com/maven-spring-vaadin-appengine/" target="_blank">Using Maven to create a project with Spring, Vaadin and Google AppEngine</a>. Not as easy as it might sound.
  2. <a title="Maven simplifies Seams and Facelets development" href="http://www.streamhead.com/maven-simplifies-seam-facelets-development-handle-xml/" target="_blank">A Maven way to configure Seam and Facelets</a>. Where I also mention the ugly side of Maven (hint: xml, xml and some more xml)

## Something new

I&#8217;ve done a bunch of posts on the latest and greats. Still for now there is one language in particular that keeps holding my interest (I really, really should program something with it): <a title="Clojure at Devoxx 2009" href="http://www.streamhead.com/discovering-clojure-compojure/" target="_blank">Clojure. It&#8217;s Lisp for the Java Virtual Machine</a>.

Next to new programming language, Java has also recently moved to mobile devices. For a second time. First there was the Java Mobile Edition, which was plagued by half-assed implementations, a scattered hardware platform and many proprietary APIs. Now there&#8217;s is Android. <a title="Android, No-cost Development Platform" href="http://www.streamhead.com/android-nocost-development-platform/" target="_blank">A Google backed, entirely free mobile development platform</a>.

Although I think we still need to see some <a title="Android Development Tools and Programs" href="http://www.streamhead.com/android-development-tools-programs/" target="_blank">really good tools</a> before Android will boom.

## Something old

For some reason, I&#8217;ve always liked Java applets. In principle they allow you to use Java in the browser, just as you would ActionScript. That&#8217;s the principle, sadly applets have been plagued by many problems, not the least the slow startup time.

However, <a title="Remember Java Applets?" href="http://www.streamhead.com/remember-java-applets/" target="_blank">I believe Java applets are long overdue for a comeback</a>. They can be used for web 2.0 business application development, but just as well for hardware 3D. Applets have had it for a long time, while Flash has only recently caught up. <a title="hardware 3D in your browser" href="http://www.streamhead.com/tutorial-jmonkeyengine-applet-hardware-3d-in-the-browser/" target="_blank">Check out this short tutorial on how to get started</a>.

## Documentation

And if that wasn&#8217;t enough, there&#8217;s one other incredible thing about Java: Java and the many libraries are extremely well documented. And it&#8217;s all free. Just check out <a title="5 great DZone Refcards" href="http://www.streamhead.com/5-favorite-dzone-refcardz/" target="_blank">the DZone Refcardz for quick reference cards</a> that are great to keep right on your desk.

If you want to get into game development after you&#8217;ve seen the 3D, head on over to <a title="13 resources to get started in game programming" href="http://www.streamhead.com/13-game-programming-links/" target="_blank">this list of prime documentation and tutorial resources</a>. Not all Java, but it should get you started.

Enjoy! If you have suggestions for things to write on, just leave a comment or <a title="Contact me" href="http://www.streamhead.com/contact/" target="_blank">send me a message</a>. If you like to keep up-to-date with this blog, there are a few subscription options to your right.
