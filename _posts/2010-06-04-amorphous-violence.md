Yes, <a title="Amorphous+" href="http://www.kongregate.com/games/innocuousGames/amorphous/" target="_blank">Amorphous+</a> is <a title="Best of Casual Gameplay 2008, JayIsGames" href="http://jayisgames.com/best-of/2008/action-or-arcade-results/" target="_blank">JayIsGames&#8217; game of the year for 2008</a>. Yes, I&#8217;m terribly late to the party. But yes, this game is still worth a mention. You are the guy with the sword, standing in the middle, without cover and waves and waves of badies keep attacking you.

<!--more-->That&#8217;s all there is to this game. The controls are as simple as the premise. Yet, the game stays fresh, even after many many plays. It&#8217;s this generation&#8217;s 

<a title="Asteroids video game" href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Asteroids_%28video_game%29" target="_blank">Asteroids</a>. The enemies are varied, the achievements are plenty. And you, you&#8217;ll keep coming back for one more session of slaying.
