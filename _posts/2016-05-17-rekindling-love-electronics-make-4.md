Today, I&#8217;m soldering. I&#8217;m putting together a basic electronic circuit, just because I can. Thanks to [the Boldport club](http://www.boldport.com/club/), this is going to be a monthly thing and, on top of that, I get an insight in the history of the circuitry that I&#8217;m making.

Way back, I had a few electronics project kits. They came with an instruction manual that explained how to create those 160 different design. But the fun thing was trying to build something new with the provided components. Experimentation that usually ended with blowing up a transistor. Luckily replacements were cheap.

Over time, I got more into software and the electronic components started gathering dust.

[The Boldport club](http://www.boldport.com/club/) is a great way to get back in touch. For the price of a magazine subscription, you get a new small electronic project every month.

  * The project boards are carefully designed. Just looking at them is awesome.
  * They aren&#8217;t the easiest circuits, but they are basic enough so they aren&#8217;t overwhelming.
  * All projects come with a history. Reading up on it is a delightful waste of time.
  * None of the projects are straightforward. Yes, there is a manual, but if you want to discover everything for yourself, Saar has many hints to help you out without spoiling everything.
  * You can just feel it. So much love went into creating these projects.

Last week, I finally managed to put together the first project. It was shipped in March, but due to shipping issues, I only got it last month (thanks to Saar for promptly fixing this!). It took me half an hour of preparation and another half hour of soldering. And it worked! I couldn&#8217;t be more happy.
