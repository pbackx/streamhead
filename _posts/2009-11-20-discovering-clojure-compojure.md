By the time you read this, <a title="Devoxx 2009" href="http://devoxx.com/display/DV09/Home" target="_blank">Devoxx 2009</a> will be almost over. Another year of talks on all things related to Java. A great moment every year to discover new technology, rekindle with old colleagues and get inspired. This year I took my iPod Touch with me and tried <a title="pbackx's Twitter page" href="http://twitter.com/pbackx" target="_blank">to Tweet a little</a>, when the network allowed it. That turned out to be a great idea.

<a title="Clojure" href="http://clojure.org/" target="_blank">Clojure</a> is a relatively new language that I&#8217;ve been wanting to discover and try out for some time now. So seeing a talk about it, set me into action. I knew Clojure is a functional language that compiles to Java bytecode, but that&#8217;s about it. What I didn&#8217;t know was that Clojure is basically Lisp for the JVM. It uses <a title="Wikipedia - Lisp " href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Lisp_%28programming_language%29" target="_blank">Lisp</a>&#8216;s immediately recognizable parenthesized lists.

What attracts me in Clojure is how clean the language is. With very little syntax and just a few building blocks, anything is possible. Function execution has no side-effects, something which should appeal to any programmer, but might also raise a few questions.

A question that immediately came to mind, was how to incorporate this in a web application. Web applications are my bread and butter after all. I tweeted this question and, behold, the power of Twitter, I instantly got <a title="abedra's answer" href="http://twitter.com/abedra/status/5826233637" target="_blank">two</a> <a title="stuarthalloway's answer" href="http://twitter.com/stuarthalloway/status/5826054334" target="_blank">thumbs</a> up for <a title="compojure on github" href="http://github.com/weavejester/compojure" target="_blank">compojure</a> (and <a title="compojure tutorial" href="http://groups.google.com/group/compojure/browse_thread/thread/3c507da23540da6e?pli=1" target="_blank">tutorial</a>).

An elegant solution for a not so elegant problem. And one more thing to try out.

And I have a questions for my readers: do you have any experience applying functional programming to web applications?
