Once upon a time, I was really into beatmixing. I never felt like investing in turntables and huge unwieldy record collections, so I was an MP3 DJ. I used the very affordable and incredibly good AtomixMP3 program.

However, now that I wanted to pick up the MP3 DJing once again, <a title="AtomixMP3" href="http://www.virtualdj.com/products/atomixmp3.html" target="_blank">I noticed that the program hasn&#8217;t been maintained or upgraded in years</a>. And <a title="Virtual DJ" href="http://www.virtualdj.com/" target="_blank">the replacement</a> has become pretty expensive for some one who is going to use this program once or twice a year.

So I was pleasantly surprised when I ran into <a title="Mixxx | Free Digital DJ Software" href="http://www.mixxx.org/" target="_blank">Mixxx</a>. It is a little more bare-bones, but it has all the features I need: output to multiple channels or soundcards and beatmatching. The BPM algorithm seems to be a little less sophisticated than the one Virtual DJ is using. But if you&#8217;re not happy with the automatic one, you can always tap your own rhythm.

It doesn&#8217;t do sound effects and some other fancy stuff, but I hardly ever used them anyway.

So I&#8217;m off to hook up my mixing panel and spin those beats.
