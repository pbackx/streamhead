The latest buzz in techland is <a title="Evernote homepage" href="http://evernote.com/" target="_blank">Evernote</a>. It&#8217;s basically a note keeping application. What&#8217;s so special about that? you wonder. I too was wondering, why this would be any better than basically anything else on the market (I was using a combination of Google Docs and local folders which works pretty well for me). So I took the plunge and have been trying out Evernote for a few weeks now.

First there are the features any one is raving about

  * Evernote tries very very hard to make **adding notes as easy as possible**. There are many ways to add them, but I must confess I only used about two, namely, entering them in the Evernote rich client application and using the web clip option inside Firefox. All the other stuff, I either couldn&#8217;t use (iPhone, audio clips) or was just not very useful to me (email, MMS)
  * **Optical character recognition** (OCR) even for handwritten message. I assume this might be handy if you&#8217;re importing much &#8220;real life&#8221; notes, but I didn&#8217;t really need it.
  * The &#8220;**ink**&#8221; feature looks pretty spiffy, but it&#8217;s pretty much unusable on the go with a trackpad (or the little knob)

And for me the killer feature is:

  * **Easy synchronizing**. I tend to write a lot on my laptop when it&#8217;s not connected to the Internet. Until now I always used a basic text editor (<a title="PSPad - freeware text editor" href="http://www.pspad.com/" target="_blank">PSPad</a> is great) but it left me with an uneasy feeling. What if my hard disk crashes? Making a backup to memory stick or the net was a manual affair (so it never happened). Now it&#8217;s just the click of a button. If you&#8217;re very text oriented: Google Docs can be used offline.
  * Also important to note, for a product in beta, the help is very good. It&#8217;s certainly worth a bit of your time. However, I couldn&#8217;t find any info on entering geographical data.
