One of the main aims of Kanban is to make the process more visible and therefor measurable. Kanban can be &#8220;bolted onto&#8221; many project methodologies and make them more visible from the outside.

<a title="Applying Kanban to IT Processes, part 1" href="http://blogs.lessthandot.com/index.php/ITProfessionals/ITProcesses/applying-kanban-to-it-processes-part-1" target="_blank">Part 1 introduces Kanban</a>, which is a little too vague in my opinion. But <a title="Applying Kanban to IT Processes, part 2" href="http://blogs.lessthandot.com/index.php/ITProfessionals/ITProcesses/applying-kanban-to-it-processes-part-2" target="_blank">part 2 is where it gets really interesting</a> and is the &#8220;must-read&#8221; article of the bunch. A very concise, down-to-earth and understandable application of the Kanban principles. <a title="Applying Kanban to IT Processes, part 3" href="http://blogs.lessthandot.com/index.php/ITProfessionals/ITProcesses/applying-kanban-to-it-processes-part-3" target="_blank">Part 3</a> applies the principles to a short term project. <a title="Applying Kanban to IT Processes, part 4" href="http://blogs.lessthandot.com/index.php/ITProfessionals/ITProcesses/applying-kanban-to-it-processes-part-4" target="_blank">Part 4</a> was especially especially interesting for me, as it discusses applying Kanban to the development and maintenance of applications.

All of those are great reads to get into what Kanban is all about.

As with many other methodologies, you&#8217;ll notice that Kanban can be tailored to your needs. Kanban is especially flexible in this regard. You can combine Kanban ideas with other methodologies. It&#8217;s possible to tailor the columns to suite your needs and the team. And if you like you can introduce different task types.

Every Kanban afficionada will tell you Kanban is about the real physical board. However, there is one online solution that&#8217;s both extremely easy to use and configure, and manages to offer all the flexibility of Kanban and the easy and quick overview that a Kanban board delivers.

<a title="Flow.io" href="http://flow.io/tour.html" target="_blank">Flow</a> is still in beta, but it&#8217;s definitely worth tracking to see its progress.
