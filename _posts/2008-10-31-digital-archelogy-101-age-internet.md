<a title="ASCII by Jason Scott" href="http://ascii.textfiles.com/" target="_blank">Jason Scott</a> is a collector of bits. Mostly bits from the 80s. Back in the 80s and early 90s, bits didn&#8217;t travel that far or easily. There was Internet, but it was only accessible by a handful of American academics. Us, mortal beings had to be content with sneakernet and BBS&#8217;s. So collectors of those bits should be treated with the utmost respect. They are archaeologists.

One of the remnants of the age of BBS&#8217;s is the digital newsletter. It was available in many formats, from plain text to fully interactive, visually overwhelming presentations. <a title="Your News in Full-Color GIF" href="http://ascii.textfiles.com/archives/000709.html" target="_blank">One newsletter that Jason has collected for you is GIF News</a>. While simple by today&#8217;s standards, those documents happen to perfectly capture the Zeitgeist of that era and are therefore required reading for anyone interested in where this Internet all came from.

As discussed in Jason&#8217;s blogpost, it is hard to correctly represent those newsletters. I would suggest Flickr&#8217;s full-screen slideshow mode. <a title="GIF News" href="http://www.flickr.com/photos/textfiles/sets/72157606729836665/show/" target="_blank">Start on the Flickr slideshow of the set</a> and immediatly click on the full screen button in the bottom right corner.

Time for some digital archeology.
