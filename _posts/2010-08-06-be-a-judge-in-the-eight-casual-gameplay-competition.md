<a title="Learn Python by Creating Games" href="http://www.streamhead.com/learn-programming-language/" target="_blank">I mentioned the eight Casual Gameplay Competition a month ago</a>. Now I wasn&#8217;t able to enter the competition, but that doesn&#8217;t mean I can&#8217;t <a title="CGDC8 Entries are now online!" href="http://jayisgames.com/archives/2010/08/cgdc8_entries_are_now_online.php" target="_blank">enjoy the results</a>. Isn&#8217;t the internet great?

<!--more-->Each competition has a certain theme, the previous one was on interactive fiction and this time it was all about &#8220;sandbox&#8221;. So you&#8217;re going to see a lot of sand in the 17 entries. But others took the theme a little less literal.

The quality in the games I&#8217;ve played (I still have to play a few) is mixed, going from an original idea that wasn&#8217;t executed that well to beautifully executed games that rival some of the better stuff out there.

In any case, you can&#8217;t argue with <a title="Casual Gameplay Design Competition" href="http://jayisgames.com/cgdc8/" target="_blank">17 free games</a>.
