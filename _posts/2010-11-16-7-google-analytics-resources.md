Now that <a title="Google Analytics and Vaadin" href="http://www.streamhead.com/google-analytics-and-vaadin/" target="_blank">I got Google Analytics working for my application</a>, I&#8217;m even more impressed by this little piece of software than I already was. Even with only a partially instrumented application, I&#8217;m already able to set up funnels, track conversions and see in which steps I lose customers. So it&#8217;s about time I studied the ins and outs of Analytics.

<!--more-->There are many many sites and tutorials out there, but you only need a few. Google itself has a tremendous amount of information available, so that&#8217;s where the list starts.

## Conversion University

The <a title="Google Conversion University" href="http://www.google.com/support/conversionuniversity/" target="_blank">Conversion University</a> offers a number of lessons that will teach you the fundamentals in about 20 short presentations. They are clear and to the point, make sure to stay close to the pause button. You will want to take notes and try out things.

It&#8217;s a nice addition to the standard <a title="Google Analytics Help" href="http://www.google.com/support/analytics/" target="_blank">Analytics Help</a>. And if you want even more videos, check out YouTube, the Google user has a wealth of additional Analytics presentations. <a title="Google Analytics Interface Tutorial" href="http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rHeKRvo6OhI" target="_blank">Here&#8217;s a good place to start</a>.

## Twitter and Blog

Google has a tendency to add and change functionality on a whim. And usually, their blogs are the places to be for announcements of new and adapted functions. So if you&#8217;re getting deeper into Analytics, make sure to keep an eye on the <a title="Google Analytics Blog" href="http://analytics.blogspot.com/" target="_blank">Google Analytics Blog</a>.

If you&#8217;re one of those who thinks RSS is dead, there&#8217;s always <a title="Google Analytics" href="http://twitter.com/#!/googleanalytics" target="_blank">the Google Analytics Twitter feed</a>. Which also contains a lot of additional resources and offers assistance.

## Extending and Developing

If you&#8217;re a developer, you&#8217;ll love <a title="Google Analytics - Google code" href="http://code.google.com/apis/analytics/" target="_blank">the Google Analytics API</a>. It allows you to do customized tracking and export the data. Useful if you want to create some kind of administration dashboard for your application.

## The Definitive Reference

If there ever was an article that summarized everything there is to know about Google Analytics, <a title="A Guide to Google Analytics and Useful Tools" href="http://www.smashingmagazine.com/2009/07/16/a-guide-to-google-analytics-and-useful-tools/" target="_blank">this Smashing Magazine guide is it</a>. Chockful with links, information, tools, tips. By the time you&#8217;ve read and tried this all, you&#8217;ll be a very old man. A wise man, but a gray-haired one.

## Books

When all else fails, turn to dead trees. They&#8217;re are great to have next to you when you want to look something up.
