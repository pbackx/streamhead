The more repetitive and percussion-based progressive music tends to walk a thin line between brilliant hypnotic beats and rhythms and boring never-ending loops. In many cases called the &#8220;dub&#8221; mix, it&#8217;s a very fine line and it&#8217;s a line that changes based on personal preferences, the mood, the context and many other factors.

It drags you in with the brilliant Slam mix of Coma, but the second track already has you wondering whether you should like it or not. It&#8217;s a 12 minute long study of only some of the sounds in the original version of &#8220;Park it in the shade&#8221;. And it plants the seed of doubt in your mind that will stuck with you for the rest of the disc. It&#8217;s oddly compelling. Yet at the end you still don&#8217;t know if you liked it, so you have to listen again. And again.

Personally, I think the second disc is the reason why you should buy this collection. It has the original versions of the tracks. And, the real highlight, Sasha&#8217;s score for <a title="Globe &quot;New Emissions of Light and Sound&quot;" href="http://www.globe.tv/nels/" target="_blank">Globe&#8217;s surf flick &#8220;New Emissions of Light and Sound&#8221;</a>. I haven&#8217;t seen or hadn&#8217;t heard of this movie, but now I certainly want to watch it. This is the Sasha we know and love and it shows his evolution in the musical landscape. Compared to the rest of the songs, it&#8217;s much more relaxed, but that makes it suitable for any environment and a lot of repeats.
