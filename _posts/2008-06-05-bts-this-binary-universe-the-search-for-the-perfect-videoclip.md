<img class="alignright size-full wp-image-123" title="Koyaanisqatsi" src="http://www.streamhead.com/wp-content/uploads/2008/06/koyaanisqatsi.jpg" alt="" width="339" height="300" srcset="http://www.streamhead.com/wp-content/uploads/2008/06/koyaanisqatsi.jpg 339w, http://www.streamhead.com/wp-content/uploads/2008/06/koyaanisqatsi-300x265.jpg 300w" sizes="(max-width: 339px) 100vw, 339px" />Many musicians like to add the perfect images to their sounds. Usually they end up with a 3 minute boobshow destined for MTV and the likes. Others take it to <a title="Koyaanisqatsi - Vessels" href="http://youtube.com/watch?v=hwYFxCnc9fg" target="_blank">strange, yet mindblowing extremes</a> (seriously, <a title="Philip Glass - Koyaanisqatsi" href="http://www.philipglass.com/music/films/koyaanisqatsi.php" target="_blank">Koyaanisqatsi</a> is worth at least a few blog posts on its own).

BT&#8217;s This Binary Universe looks to take the middle road. It&#8217;s certainly not your average TV videoclip, but it doesn&#8217;t seem to aspire at epic grandeur or want to be Art, with a big A. <a title="BT - This Binary Universe fragment" href="http://youtube.com/watch?v=t-duqsCFXxc" target="_blank">Watch this and judge for yourself</a>, but I think, BT definitely manages to create a perfect synergy between music and video.

I&#8217;m not sure if <a title="BT's official site" href="http://www.btmusic.com/" target="_blank">BT</a> himself needs any introduction. From the early 90s when he started as one of the pioneers in trance, he has been on my radar. With <a title="if you buy one thing today, make sure it's this" href="http://www.discogs.com/release/18434" target="_blank">Remember</a> he peaked, but he didn&#8217;t fade or burn out. He spread his wings and showed that he was not limited to the club genre. He has enough talent to keep you interested at home or the movies or the car, not just on the dancefloor.

This Binary Universe was released in 2006, quite a while ago, but I tend to be slow in my appreciation.
  
The album shows that BT&#8217;s music is powerful enough to be the centerpiece. He did already make movie soundtracks in the past, but here it&#8217;s the music that leads and the visuals that follow.

Better late than never.
