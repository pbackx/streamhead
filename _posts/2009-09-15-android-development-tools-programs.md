Back on my Android project, I am now going to the extensive documentation on the Android site itself and have installed the development tools. Everything went smooth, <a title="cannot open Android xml in Eclipse 3.1" href="http://groups.google.com/group/android-developers/browse_thread/thread/f4ba97f99c3b470c" target="_blank">except for one minor glitch</a>. I remember from my previous, very short, stint with Android, that those tools where extremely helpful.

I also remember that keeping your application flow in line was pretty complicated. Most Android apps are constructed from a number of different, almost stand-alone, blocks. Keeping the overview of all of that became a hassle fairly quickly. So here&#8217;s a partial overview of my application.

It&#8217;s fairly basic for now, but I&#8217;ll expand it as I make progress. One thing I would have loved, was the ability to convert this visual information into an Android manifest. The existing Android editor is pretty extensive and offers a lot of help, but it would be even nicer if there was something even more graphical.

This seemed to me a question that would fairly regularly popup in Android developers minds, so I searched Google, but couldn&#8217;t find anything. In fact the only Android development tool that I could find was <a title="Droiddraw" href="http://www.droiddraw.org/" target="_blank">Droiddraw</a>, which seems to have lost its reason to exist. Drawing user interfaces is now part of the Android Development Tools. Maybe it has some more options, I&#8217;ll figure this out when I get to the point where I need a GUI.

Are there any Android tools out there, which you can recommend?
