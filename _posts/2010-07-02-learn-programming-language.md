&#8230; is to write a program. So in my quest to study <a title="Drinking the Python Kool-aid" href="http://www.streamhead.com/drinking-the-python-kool-aid/" target="_blank">Python</a>, I was looking for something to create. Enter <a title="Casual Gameplay Design Competition" href="http://jayisgames.com/archives/2010/06/game_design_competition_8.php" target="_blank">JayIsGames&#8217;s Casual Gameplay Design Competition</a>, <a title="Interactive Fiction Design Competition" href="http://www.streamhead.com/interactive-fiction-design-competition/" target="_blank">previously mentioned</a> and much loved. Sadly they only allow games that run in a browser, but that&#8217;s not going to hold me back. I&#8217;m going to jump that hurdle when it comes to it (<a title="Try Python" href="http://www.trypython.org/" target="_blank">I&#8217;ve already seen some possibilities</a>)

<!--more-->And otherwise, I can always enter the PyWeek challenge. Some great stuff was already created for this competition (check out 

<a title="Kyte Story" href="http://www.pyweek.org/e/midnightsun/" target="_blank">Kite Story</a>) so I&#8217;ve got my work cut out.

<a title="Python Game Programming" href="http://rene.f0o.com/mywiki/PythonGameProgramming" target="_blank">PyGame</a> should get me started quickly, but I might first need to study a little more than data types.

More news soon!
