It&#8217;s that time of the year again. Time to look back and look forward.

Previous years: [2015](http://www.streamhead.com/2015-is-over-welcome-2016/), [2014](http://www.streamhead.com/2014-review-2015-preview/), [2013](http://www.streamhead.com/2013-review-looking-forward-2014/), [2012](http://www.streamhead.com/year-review-2012-goals-2013/), [2011](http://www.streamhead.com/review-and-preview-2012/), [2010](http://www.streamhead.com/streamhead-in-2011/).

## 2016

So what happened last year:

  * We finally moved! Building a new house was a huge and stressful project that took way longer than expected. It&#8217;s good to have this (mostly) of our plate.
  * I got some &#8220;[makes](http://www.streamhead.com/tag/maker-challenge/)&#8221; done and documented. As usual, a lot less than I would have liked, but it&#8217;s a start. I also have a bunch of unfinished ones which may re-appear next year.
  * Most of my spare time was spend on my 3D printer. It was fun and 2017 should be the year I actually get something done with the printer (except printing toys, which I&#8217;ve done quite a bit of)
  * I was able to do some cool stuff for my consulting client. Some highlights: Build a Spring Boot app from scratch and move Jenkins to AWS.
  * [I read 16 books, which was 4 shy of my 20 books goal](https://www.goodreads.com/user_challenges/4236567). I&#8217;m happy with the selection I read. I could have gamed the system by reading shorter books, but I&#8217;m glad I didn&#8217;t.

## 2017

So what&#8217;s up for 2017? I have some general targets of things I&#8217;d like to do, but knowing how things go, I may end up going in a completely different direction anyway:

  * I want to print something that also involves my passion for electronics. I&#8217;m currently thinking of a quadcopter or a robot, but nothing has been decided yet.
  * I have signed up for Udacity&#8217;s AI nanodegree. Last year I started Coursera&#8217;s 3D Printing specialization, which was really cool until they stopped producing the course halfway through (without any explanation). I hope things go better with this one. In any case, I want to apply AI and deep learning principles in practice. Maybe by joining a competition on Kaggle.
  * I started rewatching  Star Trek the Next Generation. This year will be the 20th anniversay of the airing of the first episode.
  * I&#8217;d like to reread the first 6 Dune novels I read a long time ago and tackle on a few of the new books (the ones not by Frank Herbert). Given my reading speed and the fact that I want to read other books, this is not going to be done this year.

So &#8230; lets get going!
