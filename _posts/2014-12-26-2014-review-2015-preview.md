As every year, I take a brief moment to look back at the previous year and forward to the next year.

<!--more-->

Previous years: [2013](http://www.streamhead.com/2013-review-looking-forward-2014/), [2012](http://www.streamhead.com/year-review-2012-goals-2013/), [2011](http://www.streamhead.com/review-and-preview-2012/), [2010](http://www.streamhead.com/streamhead-in-2011/).

## 1. 2014

The major change this year was going fromÂ full-time work to freelance contracting. Since October I&#8217;ve been a senior freelance Java developer at TomTom.

Although I did not really plan for it, I&#8217;m happy I finally made the switch. I&#8217;m working on a very challenging and interesting project and it&#8217;s a lot closer to home than previously.

### 1.a. FCTR &#8211; my SaaSÂ sideproject

For [FCTR](http://www.streamhead.com/launching-my-first-vaadin-appengine-project/), I did not achieve my main income goalÂ I had set. In spite of a pretty serious time investment into marketing and sales, I did not come close to the numbers I wanted to reach.

I clearly have a problem solution fit. I have happy customers, that keep using the application and there are hardly any requests for more functionality or major changes.

However, the application does not have [a product market fit](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Product/market_fit). The customers that are using my application and that are generating most of the income, are not the ones I expected.

</div>

Other things I did for FCTR:

  * I finally hired a part-time assistant.
  * I spent a ton of time trying to migrate of of CloudBees ([here](http://www.streamhead.com/replacing-cloudbees-devcloud-part-1-repository/) and [here](http://www.streamhead.com/migrating-continuous-delivery-openshift-part-2-building-java-projects/)), but eventually realized that was costing me a lot more than paying for this excellent service.<figure id="attachment_3757" style="width: 660px" class="wp-caption aligncenter">

### 1.b. DiscogsScan &#8211; one-function Android app

I was not able to spend a lot of time on [my DiscogsScan app](http://www.streamhead.com/discogs-scan/). The little time I did have, I used to upgrade to the latest Discogs API.

Initially, I hesitated whether or not to upgrade the app at all. Without the upgrade, it would have become completely useless. But I still like the problem and there&#8217;s clearly a market for this so I went for it. Although the review are mixed, what it does, it does well.

### 1.c. Writing on the blog

I did end the year with a few posts ðŸ™‚

### 1.d. Kindle ebook

Back in 2012, I wrote [a Kindle ebook](http://www.streamhead.com/how-to-make-videos-for-free/). It basically explained how to set up VirtualBox and run Kdenlive. I did enjoy the process, but felt the material may have been a little too technical for the Kindle store.

It has been selling a few copies each month ever since August 2012.

And this year, I got my first 2 reviews. I&#8217;m not sure where these suddenly came from, but it was nice to read that my book actually achieved its goal for those 2 customers.

It&#8217;s a small one, but it&#8217;s a win!

## 2. 2015

My main goal will be to keep working on a successful Java freelancing career. But there&#8217;s always a little time left.

### 2.a. FCTR

I&#8217;ve been struggling with FCTR for about 4 years. It&#8217;sÂ clear the current trajectory is going nowhere. This is not a long, slow ramp of death. It&#8217;s not &#8220;ramping&#8221; at all.

<div class="embed-vimeo" style="text-align: center;">
</div>

So something&#8217;s got to change. There are major VAT changes I&#8217;d like to add to the application, but I&#8217;m holding of untilÂ **I figure out my market & how to reach them**.

I want to have this figured out by the end of January, otherwise I&#8217;mÂ putting the application into maintenance mode (probably even closing down registrations).

### 2.b. Other

Other than that, I have no firm plans.Â I&#8217;ve been aching to work on something different than FCTR. But I&#8217;m going to hold of for now.

It may be:

  * Something in the same market (smallscale entrepreneurs)
  * I have a lot of ideas for DiscogsScan
  * Revive my video eBook?
  * Something completely different

At the very least, my approach will be much more structured and I will be starting with a much smaller product.

Enjoy the end of the year and see you in 2015!
