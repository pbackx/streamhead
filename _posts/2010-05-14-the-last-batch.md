Well, <a title="Impulses" href="http://www.streamhead.com/alcatraz-bastardo-ep-essay-impulses/" target="_blank">it has finally</a> <a title="Records for sale" href="http://www.streamhead.com/records-sale-vinyl-bugging/" target="_blank">come to</a> <a title="vinyl" href="http://www.streamhead.com/vinyl-the-choice-and-some-astralasia-musings/" target="_blank">this</a>. I&#8217;ve put <a title="eBay vinyl sales" href="http://shop.benl.ebay.be/kbaxter_be/m.html?_nkw=&_armrs=1&_from=&_ipg=&_trksid=p3686" target="_blank">the last batch of vinyl records up for sale on eBay</a>. After that, it&#8217;s all digital for me. While vinyl still survives for some, it&#8217;s a very distant memory for most. Hence this final ode to great trance and progressive that was once the exclusive domain of vinyl. Now, a lot can be both from iTunes or specialized stores like Beatport. And I&#8217;ve got a Grooveshark widget to prove it.

<!--more-->For me, the highlight of this list is most certainly BT&#8217;s Remember. It shaped trance and even progressive. Ranging from the straight-on Paul Van Dyk dancefloor madness to the afterhours deepness of the Mood II Swing mix. It&#8217;s all brilliant. But you don&#8217;t have to believe me, you can listen for yourself.



If you don&#8217;t know <a title="Grooveshark" href="http://listen.grooveshark.com/" target="_blank">Grooveshark</a>, it&#8217;s a great service that lets you manage and stream your playlists. The choice is incredibly wide and deep. You can&#8217;t download music, but if you like something, there are links to buy it on one or more sites.

It&#8217;s a great service.

A few of the tracks I couldn&#8217;t find. For instance, Jam&Spoon&#8217;s &#8220;Don&#8217;t call it love&#8221; LP or some of the mixes of Resistance D&#8217;s &#8220;You were there&#8221;. But really, I don&#8217;t think any one can offer everything that was ever released.

<a title="eBay vinyl sales" href="http://shop.benl.ebay.be/kbaxter_be/m.html?_nkw=&_armrs=1&_from=&_ipg=&_trksid=p3686" target="_blank">It&#8217;s time for some shopping</a>.
