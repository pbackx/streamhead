Over the last few months, I&#8217;ve developed three plugins for [Tristan Kromer](https://twitter.com/#!/TriKro "@TriKro") of [GrasshopperHerder.com](http://grasshopperherder.com/ "Lean Startups and Customer Development"). He has gracefully donated these to the community, so now they are available to all: Easily create tweetable text, manage ads and monitor their performance, integrate KissMetrics. There&#8217; something for every one.

<!--more-->These are the first 3 plugins I created that are publicly available. It doesn&#8217;t happen a lot that some one who pays for development decides to make it available to every one. So don&#8217;t forget to thank 

[Tristan](http://tristankromer.com/contact "Contact Tristan Kromer").

## [TweetHerder](http://wordpress.org/extend/plugins/tweetherder/ "TweetHerder")

From a technical point, this is the easiest plugin of the three. But I think it will be the most popular. It allows you to easily add &#8220;tweet this&#8221; buttons to quotes in your posts. Like this one:

[tweetherder]If you have a WordPress blog, you should try the TweetHerder plugin.[/tweetherder]

## [KissHerder](http://wordpress.org/extend/plugins/kissherder/ "KissHerder")

This plugin allows you to add the KissMetrics code to your blog. It is different than the other plugins available, because it instruments many of your blogs functions. For instance, it will send events when a user enters a comment. There is also code available for tracking Facebook, Google+ and Twitter buttons. [Check the FAQ for the details](http://wordpress.org/extend/plugins/kissherder/faq/ "integrating with all kinds of social buttons") and if you have something that isn&#8217;t supported yet, please let us know.

## [AdHerder](http://wordpress.org/extend/plugins/adherder/ "AdHerder")

Easily the most complicated plugin of the 3, this one allows you to define different adds and run A/B tests. It tracks user behavior and you can configure the plugin so that a user does not get to see an ad again if he has already clicked on it.

There are many options and it requires some tweaking to get the most out of it, but it is very powerful and the results can be very enlightening.

Due to its nature, it requires a little power from your blog server. So I would not suggest it to blogs that are already flirting with the limits of their shared hosting plan. Any one on a VPS or dedicated server should be fine.

## Feedback

If you try any of the plugins. We&#8217;d love to hear from you. Is something not clear? Is there a bug? Do you like it? Let us know.
