It looks like the only chance at skiing I&#8217;ll have this season, [might not be happening](http://www.gerardmer-ski.com/). Damn you global warming. Or maybe [the weather&#8217;s just not on my side](http://www.weather.com/outlook/travel/businesstraveler/tenday/FRXX0525?from=hrly_topnav_business). [The Vosges](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Vosges) is the only region that is just within reach for a weekend trip and still has a somewhat good chance at snow. All [the great ski areas](http://www.skifrance.fr/) require a holiday of a week to make up for the long trip.

So yeah, I already have one good intention for next year, more skiing. [Canada might be nice](http://www.skicanada.org/site/index.cfm), a little on the expensive side maybe, but one has to set high goals.
