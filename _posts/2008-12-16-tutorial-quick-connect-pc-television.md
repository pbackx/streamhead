Many people seem to think this is hard, it&#8217;s not. It might be a little technical, but on any decent PC it will take you at most 15 minutes to get going. The first part is what this post is all about. It is also the one that will give you the most headaches. You need a cable between your PC and your television.

There are many types of connectors and there are many ways to connect those. Some are expensive and some are dirt cheap. If you need some guidance to get you started on your cable search, I have created a little program to <a title="cable picker: pick your pc to tv connection" href="http://www.thecouchtv.com/cablepicker/" target="_blank">help you pick your cable</a>.

On the more technical side, this little application was made using <a title="smartgwt" href="http://code.google.com/p/smartgwt/" target="_blank">SmartGWT</a>, a GWT API library for <a title="SmartClient: RIA Ajax framework" href="http://www.smartclient.com/" target="_blank">SmartClient</a>. SmartClient is a neat RIA library and GWT makes them incredibly easy to use, program and debug. I know, SmartClient is yet another option in the already crowed RIA field, but it&#8217;s certainly worth a try.
