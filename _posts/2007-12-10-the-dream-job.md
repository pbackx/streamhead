Why is it, you can&#8217;t get out of bed in the morning? Why do you prefer to just do nothing, instead of actually getting some work done? Even if you had the guts to just get up, go see your boss and quit, how would you know the next job is going to be any better? And if you&#8217;d win the lottery and never had to work one more day in your entire life, would you know how to fill the void

It&#8217;s all about taking a step back, and figuring out what you really want to do. David Allen, of &#8220;Getting Things Done&#8221; fame, calls it the 50.000+ mile high view, Timothy Ferris (&#8220;4 hour work week&#8221;) labels them dreamlines. If you ever liked your job, the things you&#8217;re working on and people you work with, all you need is some proper career planning. Bend the job until you like it again, or until it breaks. In that case, there are other opportunities. And most of all, never have regrets. Don&#8217;t never look back, do look back! But don&#8217;t let the wrong decisions keep you down, learn from them.

How about owning a <a href="http://www.koenigsegg.se/" title="random dream car" target="_blank">Koenigsegg CCX</a>? Do you really want to own the car? Pay for the maintenance and fuel? Or do you just want to drive a fast car? Want something to show of with? Think about the reason and you might find other solutions, sometimes more affordable. And even if it really is the Koenigsegg you want, how much will it cost you? Have you even bothered to calculate the monthly cost? Maybe you should, maybe you&#8217;d be surprised, or maybe not, but if you haven&#8217;t tried, why keep walking around with that same dream?

Take a step back.

Books can help, but they can only show the way. You are the one in charge. But that&#8217;s a good thing.
