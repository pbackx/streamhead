A lot of the stuff I buy is just an impulse decision. One afternoon, I decide I&#8217;d like a new music cd for the car. I go out and return with 5 cd&#8217;s, a few games and maybe a book. These days, I don&#8217;t do it all that often anymore, mostly because I simply don&#8217;t have the time for it any more and also because I never finished any of those games or books (the audio usually gets to be played).

Surprisingly, I hardly ever bought something I didn&#8217;t like. Quite to the contrast, I found a few gems I would have never bought if I had done the research.

On the music front, I picked up <a title="Eat Static - Science of the Gods" href="http://www.discogs.com/Eat-Static-Science-Of-The-Gods/master/78947" target="_blank">Eat Static&#8217;s Science of the Gods</a> because I had heard about the group somewhere somehow, I had no idea what music to expect. But I was amazed and my musical world expanded. I bought <a title="DJ Jef K - My House" href="http://www.discogs.com/Various-My-House-A-House-Music-Compilation-By-DJ-Jef-K-Paris/release/53616" target="_blank">Jef K&#8217;s My House</a> compilation because I really liked the image (seriously) and I&#8217;ve never heard better house since. Authechre, Orbital, Ken Ishii, etc would never have entered my cd rack if I hadn&#8217;t experimented.

Amidst those many positive experiences, the negative ones are far and few between. So I hardly ever bother reading reviews, I tend to go with the flow. If I watch a movie, I usually read the reviews only after I&#8217;ve seen it.

This post is about one of those negative experiences. I bought the Bastardo EP by Alcatraz at a record fair, back when I was still buying records. The most important reason I brought it home was that I got a discount when I bought 5 records and I only had picked out 4. I though it was going to be an ok trance record, but it turned out to be a bummer. A cross between the hardest of trance and borderline boring techno (not all techno is boring, mind you). It&#8217;s a style, that, for some reason, has become popular again lately. I don&#8217;t know why, but the record seems to be pretty sought after.

Here&#8217;s one track from the EP, so judge for yourself:
