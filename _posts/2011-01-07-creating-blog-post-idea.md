If you&#8217;d like to write better blog post and in less time than you&#8217;re used to, <a title="Interactive blog post generator" href="http://www.streamhead.com/technology/post-generator/" target="_blank">we&#8217;ve got a web application for that</a>. The interactive blog post idea generator helps you focus your thoughts and structure them in an understandable and clear way. It&#8217;s not a magic solution but it might help you when you&#8217;re low on ideas or morale.

<a title="Interactive blog post generator" href="http://www.streamhead.com/technology/post-generator/" target="_blank">Try the post idea generator right away</a>, or read on for the technical details.

<!--more-->Although this application isn&#8217;t very complicated, it has been on my harddrive for a while. I&#8217;ve been using it myself for a number of posts on Streamhead and, in the process, I&#8217;ve refined the application little by little. I believe it&#8217;s a great way to focus the thoughts and not get side-tracked by feed readers or Twitter clients.

I have many ideas to improve the post generator. It is based on <a title="write a solid article in 15 minutes" href="http://www.snydeysense.com/2008/09/22/write-a-solid-article-in-15-minutes/" target="_blank">an old post by David Snyder</a>, but I have many more great posts on writing well in general and writing for blogs in particular. I&#8217;d like to work in some more advice in the wizard.

Currently, my application uses jQuery, a bunch of plugins and some not-too-well-written glue code. Since <a title="JavaScript mastery" href="http://www.streamhead.com/javascript-mastery/" target="_blank">my post on JavaScript Mastery</a>, I&#8217;ve been collecting some great blog posts, articles and a few books on writing good JavaScript. I&#8217;m going to let loose all this knowledge on the application and see how I can improve both the user interface and the code.

So <a title="Interactive blog post generator" href="http://www.streamhead.com/technology/post-generator/" target="_blank">please try it out</a> and let me know your suggestions.
