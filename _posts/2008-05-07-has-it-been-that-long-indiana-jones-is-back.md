In fact, if you put any of the movies in your DVD player or boot up one of the Indy games, you will know: Indiana Jones was never away and is <a title="TheRaider.net - Indy fan site" href="http://www.theraider.net/" target="_blank">still alive and kicking</a>. No <a title="Indiana Jones and the Kingdom of the Crystal Skull" href="http://indianajones.wikia.com/wiki/Indiana_Jones_and_the_Kingdom_of_the_Crystal_Skull" target="_blank">Crystal Skull</a> needed.

LucasArts (previously LucasFilm Games) has always been a master in bringing a franchise to multiple media. You might argue, they have a very interesting back catalogue to choose from, but they are one of the few companies to pretty <a title="LucasArts games" href="http://www.mobygames.com/browse/games/lucasarts/offset,0/so,1d/list-games/" target="_blank">consistently pull it off</a>. Many of their Star Wars games are definite recommendations, but the Indy games have been lost a bit in memory. Time to change that.

The screenshots above are taken from the adventure game inspired by Indiana Jones and the Last Crusade. An entertaining movie, an excellent adventure game. Even 18 years after it was first released, it is still perfectly playable. If you can look past the dated graphics and sound, you will discover a most enjoyable game. Sadly, the game is not available from Abandonware sites (per LucasArts&#8217; request) and prices on eBay are steep, so it requires some dedication.

Worth it, if you ask me.
