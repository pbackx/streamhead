<a title="Cash Hunt - the online treasure hunt" href="http://www.cashhunt.co.uk/" target="_blank">Cash Hunt</a> is a new online game, where you solve cryptic clues to find a location and win cash money. It reminds me of alternate reality games like <a title="Alternate reality dreams" href="http://www.streamhead.com/alternate-reality-dreams/" target="_blank">Perplex City</a>, but it really is &#8220;only&#8221; a cryptic puzzle. But don&#8217;t let that discourage you, there are a few advantages.

First of all, it&#8217;s entirely free. No strings attached. Stuff like Perplex City is a real money hog.

And second, it doesn&#8217;t take over your life. It&#8217;s a neat riddle that will virtually take you through the UK while searching. It looks like an interesting search, but you don&#8217;t need to take a week of to get to the bottom of it.

I was a bit worried about privacy concerns. Many of those &#8220;free money&#8221; sites are just out to get your data. But this site seems to be 100% legit. I inquired with the owners and they promised me: there&#8217;s no reason to worry.

The next hunt starts tomorrow so be quick if you want to join. And if you <a title="Cash Hunt - the online treasure hunt" href="http://www.cashhunt.co.uk/" target="_blank">sign up</a>, don&#8217;t forget to give my mail address: peter.backx@gmail.com as a reference for that extra clue.
