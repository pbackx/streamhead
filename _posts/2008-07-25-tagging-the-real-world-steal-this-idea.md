New phones and technology allow for crazy intersections between the real life and the online/virtual one. With Google&#8217;s Android and especially <a title="Android Developer challenge" href="http://code.google.com/android/adc.html" target="_blank">the challenge</a> to win lots of cash and adoration, many ideas have surfaced. Like <a title="Bubbles - a Google Android challenge entry" href="http://blog.rabidgremlin.com/index.php/2008/04/14/bubbles-my-google-android-developer-challenge-entry" target="_blank">Bubbles</a>, which is basically, **a location based Twitter**. You can enter a status message, which is then broadcasted to every one around you. Another option Jack wanted to implement is to **attach tags or message to locations**. For instance, you could leave a little restaurant review for any one who happens to pass by.

When you have tagged everything, the next logical step is to make that information searchable. For instance, take <a title="Tag your car" href="http://gizmodo.com/5022678/g+park-iphone-app-lets-the-forgetful-bookmark-their-car" target="_blank">this neat little application</a>. It allows you to tag your car when you park it and afterwards, when you&#8217;re lost, you can use a mapping service to guide you back to its location. It&#8217;s the most basic example of what might be possible, but I&#8217;m sure many people will find it useful. Basically you could imagine many online technologies in real life. Hyperlinks between pubs, so you know where to go to when one closes or is too full. The possibilities are endless.

<img class="alignright size-full wp-image-160" title="Virtual Presence" src="http://www.streamhead.com/wp-content/uploads/2008/07/cimono-twisted-150.gif" alt="walking the web" width="150" height="63" />In contrast to this digitization of the real world, there&#8217;s a movement on the Internet that intends to the opposite to the Web. They want to add a flavor of real world social dynamics to the individual experience of browsing the net. It&#8217;s usually refered to as **<a title="Virtual Presence research" href="http://www.virtual-presence.org/" target="_blank">Virtual Presence</a>**. You get a virtual avatar that will walk with you from site to site. Sadly, in its current state it&#8217;s not very interesting as only a few people use it. Of course, similar things have been tried and done before. Sites have integrated IRC clients, and even a simple comment section brings in a flavor of social interaction.
