Another one of JayIsGames discoveries. This wonderfully simple game, called Chup. It&#8217;s a puzzle game disguised in an oldskool platform look. It has charm by the boatloads. When the chiptune music starts, you know it&#8217;s going to be fun. Don&#8217;t let yourself be distracted by the screen shots, you need to experience the simplicity of the gameplay, and the depth of wanting to get the most out of it. There are 3 ways metrics to take into account (time, number of items recovered and number of jumps). Is it always possible to get them all in one going, I&#8217;m not sure.

It&#8217;s a puzzle to solve.
