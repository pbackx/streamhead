The documentary on adult fan&#8217;s of Lego (AFOL) that you can watch on Vimeo and that I embed below caught my attention for two different reasons. First, I&#8217;m a huge Lego fan, it&#8217;s mostly &#8220;passive&#8221; but I am in awe of all the creativity that can be found on the net. And secondly, I love how one guy with a lot of time and dedication can make such an engrossing documentary.

<!--more-->I&#8217;ve featured a few 

<a title="Lego miracle cure" href="http://www.streamhead.com/feel-young-legos-miracle-cure/" target="_blank">Lego-related</a> <a title="Lego Star Wars" href="http://www.streamhead.com/unity-3d-engine-rise-lego-star-wars-quest-r2d2/" target="_blank">posts</a> before, but since I&#8217;m not really actively building models and/or contributing, I keep the coverage minimal. I believe Lego is a great way to be creative, learn and play. This documentary has all of that.

Sadly there&#8217;s not much information on the creator of the documentary, Jess Gibson (<a title="AFOL blocumentary by Jess Gibson" href="http://www.brothers-brick.com/2010/02/19/afol-a-blocumentary-by-jess-gibson/" target="_blank">even his name wasn&#8217;t easy to find</a>). As far as I can tell, this was a one-man operation, which make this all the more impressive. Great shots, interviews and production. This must have taken a lot of free time. I&#8217;m impatiently waiting for the promissed next episodes.
