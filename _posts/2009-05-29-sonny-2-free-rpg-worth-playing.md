There aren&#8217;t manyÂ  free RPG games. There are even fewer Flash RPG games and there are almost none actually worth playing. <a title="Sonny 2 - Armor Games" href="http://armorgames.com/play/2900/sonny-2" target="_blank">Sonny 2</a> is different. It combines everything you want in an RPG and mixes it up to a delightful game. It has numbers, but it&#8217;s not too deep, so it remains very accessible to players of all types.

The general gameplay is very reminiscent of an early Final Fantasy game, but without the map and focused on the fights. The graphics are great. No 3D here, but good old-time sprites. Jummy.

There isn&#8217;t too much information on the creator, called Krin. But he has <a title="KRINLABS.com forums" href="http://www.krinlabs.com/phpBB3/" target="_blank">a fairly active forum</a> which you might find interesting if you want to discover and learn more.
