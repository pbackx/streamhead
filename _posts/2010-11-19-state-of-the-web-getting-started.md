After day one of Devoxx, the talk that I found most engaging was <a title="The State of the Web - Devoxx 2010" href="http://www.devoxx.com/display/Devoxx2K10/The+State+of+the+Web" target="_blank">Dion Almaer and Ben Galbraith&#8217;s State of the Web</a>. They argued that Apple&#8217;s AppStore (and to a lesser extend Google&#8217;s App Marketplace) has created a gigantic marketplace of people willing to download and pay for applications. Previously this market was unserved, because the web does not have place to browse, it&#8217;s all about searching.

<!--more-->Dion and Ben would like to see a &#8220;WebStore&#8221; for websites. Basically what Yahoo! once was, a curated list of only the best websites. They think this is possible because with the advent of HTML5 and all of its related technologies, there really is no reason why a website should be any less interactive or any less refined than a native app.

They might have a point. Creating a HTML5 web application has the added advantage that, if done right, it&#8217;s also cross platform. If you don&#8217;t use proprietary extensions, the same web app will work on iPhone, Android and other smartphones. It&#8217;ll even work on a normal browser. Although I suppose the difference in screen resolution will be a little too huge to get a nice looking site on both extremes.

I did a little research to see what&#8217;s out there for mobile web app development. I have a few ideas to make something myself, so who knows, my first iPhone app might be coming soon. Until then, here are some good resources to get started :

  * <a title="jQTouch, jQuery plugin for mobile development" href="http://jqtouch.com/" target="_blank">jQTouch</a> is a jQuery plugin for mobile development. On my iPod Touch, the demo site was very enjoyable to navigate. I&#8217;m going to have to load it in the Android emulator soon to see how it looks there.
  * Just like jQTouch, the <a title="Titanium Cross Platform Application platform" href="http://www.appcelerator.com/products/titanium-cross-platform-application-development/" target="_blank">Appcelerator Titanium platform</a> was suggested by Dion and Ben. From the little I&#8217;ve read, I&#8217;ve gathered that the platform offers a cross-compiler that can compile one web application to many different platforms. It looks very professional and is open source so this might be the first platform I&#8217;m going to try myself.
  * <a title="iWebKit, quality iPhone Web Applications" href="http://iwebkit.net/" target="_blank">iWebKit</a> is focused on the iPhone platform. The advantage is that it looks better than jQTouch, the disadvantage is that it probably won&#8217;t look as nice on Android phones. <a title="Create an iPhone Web Application" href="http://gigaom.com/apple/how-to-create-an-iphone-web-app/" target="_blank">GigaOm has a nice tutorial</a>.

If you know any more frameworks/libraries/platforms, feel free to share them in the comments. There&#8217;s always room for some more choices.
