Gravity Bone could be the indie game equivalent of Portal. If only it was a little longer. 2 years ago Brendon Chung&#8217;s Blendo Games released Gravity Bone. More a concept than an actual game. It&#8217;s still worth playing today.
  
<!--more-->Just before I finished this little game, I thought I was onto a great action puzzler to haul me over until Portal 2 comes around next year. Sadly, just after that thought the game ended.

If you haven&#8217;t played the game, I&#8217;m not going to spoil it. You step into the role of some kind of hitman in a stylish cube-faced world. <a title="BLENDO Games" href="http://www.blendogames.com/" target="_blank">That should be enough to make you go out and grab the game</a>.

Judging by the docs, I got the impression that Brendon had material for a much longer game that would consist of using a number of tools in increasingly complex and imaginative situations. For some reason though (money?) it appears he never got around to it.

And that&#8217;s a real shame.

Maybe we should create an indie games fund. There are a few sites out there that allow musicians to let people buy a share of their music productions. Do we need something similar for indie games?
