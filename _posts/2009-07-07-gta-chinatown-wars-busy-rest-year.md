To deal with <a title="Time Managing the Pile of Shame" href="http://www.streamhead.com/time-managing-pile-shame/" target="_blank">my growing pile of shame</a>, I decided to focus my efforts on one thing at a time. So for the last two weeks, I&#8217;ve been trying to put all my spare time into completing just one thing. To choose my single point of attention, I simply picked the first thing I came across, which was my Nintendo DS (the old & heavy one) with <a title="GTA on Nintendo DS" href="http://www.streamhead.com/gta-nintendo-ds-feel-retro-touch/" target="_blank">Grand Theft Auto Chinatown Wars</a> in it.

In hindsight, that probably wasn&#8217;t the brightest choice to try out my new &#8220;time management system&#8221;. I&#8217;ve already sunk a considerable amount of time into the game and it currently tells me I&#8217;m at 25% complete. I&#8217;m not sure if this percentage just concerns the story campaigns or it&#8217;s everything that can be done in the game.

At first, it took my some practice to get the hang of the control system. I&#8217;m sure that probably explains why it didn&#8217;t sell as well as people hoped. You need to work at it for about an hour. Once you get the hang of it however, Chinatown Wars turns out to be a one of the better GTA games.

My goal is to finish the story, but I always get sidetracked by other missions, racing a go-kart, trafficing drugs, etc. They are just begging to try them and loose a few hours.

If you&#8217;re still not convinced you should buy this game, here&#8217;s another opinion:

One thing that will speed up your progress a little (and, personally, I don&#8217;t consider it cheating, but you might think different), is <a title="GTA Chinatown Wars Map" href="http://www.gtaforums.com/index.php?showtopic=404845" target="_blank">this perfect map</a>. It is an indispensable tool so you don&#8217;t get lost too long searching for a health kit or a rampage.

Only one question remains: how do I throw grenades while driving without getting a third hand?

Currently, you can get it very cheap at Amazon:
