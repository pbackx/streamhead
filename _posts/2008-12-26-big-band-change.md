Matthew Herbert is something special. He is a sampler, and he does not re-use any existing samples. He makes his own, wherever that might take him. He is also very politically engaged and wants to change the world through his music.

But I&#8217;m not sure if any of that matters, because, above all, he is a composer of great music. <a title="The Matthew Herbert Big Band - There is Me and There is You" href="http://www.matthewherbertbigband.com/" target="_blank">&#8220;There&#8217;s Me and There&#8217;s You&#8221;</a> is his latest album, featuring tracks that are both very experimental, but at the same time, thoroughly enjoyable poppy tunes. I&#8217;m not going into the details, you can read a lot of interesting tidbits in the booklet and on the site. Just enjoy the music.
