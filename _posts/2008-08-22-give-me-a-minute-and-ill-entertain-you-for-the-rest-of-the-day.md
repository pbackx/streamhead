Ok, ok, I&#8217;ll be honest, it will only be about an hour, not a day. <a title="Mister Coo: El Laberinto Esférico" href="http://www.mistercoo.com/laberinto.html" target="_blank">Mister Coo in El Laberinto Esférico</a> is one more Flash game that you should absolutely try. <a title="Interactive toys" href="http://www.streamhead.com/?p=88" target="_blank">I&#8217;ve previously mentioned</a> that all innovation in game-land seems to be in short online Flash games. Well, This is another example.

It starts out as a <a title="choose your own adventure on Wikipedia" href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Choose_Your_Own_Adventure" target="_blank">choose your own adventure</a> type of game, but turns out to be something different. And it certainly isn&#8217;t finished when you think it is. But that&#8217;s about all I am going to say.

Once again: <a title="Mr Coo on Jay is Games" href="http://jayisgames.com/archives/2008/07/mr_coo_el_laberinto_esferico.php" target="_blank">Hat tip to Jay is Games</a>. I would suggest to just play the game and not read the review, it spoils a few surprises.

And if you still want more, the Mr Coo character was originally used in a number of animations. <a title="Mr Coo wins" href="http://coldhardflash.com/flash-animation-10-best-animated-mr-coo" target="_blank">Here&#8217;s one</a> that won an award.

Enjoy!
