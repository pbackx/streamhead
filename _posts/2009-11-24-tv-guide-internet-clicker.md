<a title="Clicker, what's on online" href="http://www.clicker.com/" target="_blank">Clicker</a>&#8216;s goal is a big one: trying to aggregate all sources of online video and showing you what is good, what is hot and what you should watch. Basically, a TV guide for the video content available on the Internet.

Now, that&#8217;s certainly not an easy thing to do. There are millions of video&#8217;s available and most of them are not worth watching. Its unclear how the selection process works, but the people at Clicker do an admirable job of only showing you stuff you might want to watch. If you long for a nice fix of Internet video, it&#8217;s a pretty good starting place.

While not perfect, I think Clicker is a pretty good first version of what it could become. Here are two things I&#8217;d love to see added (we always want more, don&#8217;t we):

  * Some type of filtering for US-only channels. In some categories, I can&#8217;t watch 95% of the shows (Hulu etc.). It would be nice to be able to filter those out. However, that might leave some categories pretty empty. Of course, that&#8217;s a problem with the current state of Internet video, not with Clicker (but that&#8217;s another discussion)
  * The possibility to play everything from the Clicker interface would be killer. Now, in many cases, one has to click through to the hosting website. Again, I don&#8217;t think this is something Clicker has much control over, but it would be cool if it were possible.
  * Some more social features. I guess this isn&#8217;t available because it&#8217;s the very first release, but some rating and discussion would be neat.

Otherwise, great web application, that you should check out. Especially if you&#8217;re a US citizen.
