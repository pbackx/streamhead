Whether you like it or not, our lifestyle is based on **a massive industrial complex**. From the enormous mines in Africa to the endless factory floors in China. They are the cogs in the giant machine that we call the **economy**. It might be sputtering right now, but clearly, governments are putting up a lot of money to keep the wheels turning.

The massive scale of all this, is lost to almost any one in the West. However, sometimes, we catch a glimpse of what is out there, of the conveyer belts that move all those neat little gadgets into our houses:

  * **Ed Burtynsky** is a photographer and the subject of <a title="TED Blog: Ed Burtynsky's Manufactured Landscapes" href="http://blog.ted.com/2007/07/ed_burtynskys_b.php" target="_blank">the documentary &#8220;<strong>Manufactured Landscapes</strong>&#8220;</a>. He shows factories that never end and dumping grounds that are higher than many mountains. It&#8217;s eye opening.
  * In a different light, those same **factories can become <a title="factory photos" href="http://www.bouncingredball.com/2009/02/10/12-fantastic-photos-of-factories-in-japan/" target="_blank">a true work of art</a>**. Oddly compelling, it&#8217;s like watching a crash. Both shocking and, yet, in some strange way there&#8217;s a certain beauty to it.
  * I was reminded of another work of art, called **<a title="Kasparov by elitegroup" href="http://www.pouet.net/prod.php?which=374" target="_blank">Kasparov</a>**. When it was first shown to the world, it was an incredible demonstration of **the power of modern computers**. It brought the artificial and the real together in a show of technical know how.

Enjoy and above all: **think**.
