The large hadron collider (LHC), currently being built has stirred a lot of controversy and has had numerous setbacks. Yet the goal of this incredibly expensive piece of machinery remains unknown to many. It isn&#8217;t easy to explain how research into the fundamental building blocks of our world and universe will immediately influence our lives, but if you watch the following video, you&#8217;ll at least get a glimpse of what they are trying to achieve and how exiting this is.



Sadly, the start-up of the LHC had to be <a title="LHC breaking news" href="http://cdsweb.cern.ch/journal/popup?name=CERNBulletin&type=breaking_news&record=1164167&ln=en" target="_blank">postponed to September 2009</a>. But I guess some hick-ups are to be expected with technology this new. In the meantime, there&#8217;s a lot of information on the net. Such as <a title="LHC homepage" href="http://lhc.web.cern.ch/lhc/" target="_blank">the LHC homepage</a>, <a title="Peter McCreadys LHC panoramas" href="http://www.nerdcore.de/wp/2009/03/02/peter-mccreadys-lhc-panoramas/" target="_blank">some incredible panoramas by Peter McCready</a> and <a title="LHC@home" href="http://lhcathome.cern.ch/" target="_blank">a way to contribute idle CPU time to the project</a>.

(yes, there&#8217;s a guy in that picture)
