It took me a while and it wasn&#8217;t easy, but I&#8217;ve decided to get rid of the few vinyl record I still have lying around. I just don&#8217;t play them enough any more to justify the space they use (and the record player). I also believe that they will be in better hands elsewhere. Most of the records are collector&#8217;s items, they should be part of a real collection. Not that I plan to make much money with it, the number of people that are interested in this kind of stuff is pretty limited.

First one to enter the room, is [Astralasia](http://www.astralasia.co.uk/)&#8216;s [&#8220;Pitched Up at the Edge of Reality&#8221;](http://www.discogs.com/release/663162), the limited edition with &#8220;A.N.D.E.&#8221; tracks. Just taking out the record, starting the player, brings back a lot of memories. Judging by the website, Astralasia is still around, producing and playing music. I clearly have some catching up to do. The record label, [Magick Eye Records](http://www.magickeye.com/), clearly is not around any longer. It&#8217;s very nostalgic, to surf the Magick Eye site, try out some links, and see how much has changed.

I got to know Astralasia right around the time Goa Trance had it&#8217;s short period of fame in Belgium. One of my fonder memories, was experiencing the 1999 solar eclipse during an outdoor Goa festival. Organized by [Dance-a-delic](http://www.dance-a-delic.be/), now also sadly gone. Astralasia&#8217;s music, however, spans a number of genres, and that is probably why they are still around.

The power of vinyl is that it is very &#8220;physical&#8221;. You get those large discs, packed in large paper bags. And you can actually see the music. A good release has lots of artwork and much to discover. When you take out the records from this limited edition, you have a black and white folder. One holds the actual LP and one holds an additional LP. A little extra thrown in. There&#8217;s even a personal note on the backside of this A.N.D.E. envelope, telling you the ideal state of mind to take out this record.

It&#8217;s magic.
