![Hotel Dusk](http://streamhead.com/wp-content/uploads/2007/12/ss_preview_ntr_hoteldusk215_ss02.jpg)

On my endless quest for something new, something different, something funny, I have now stumbled on mobile entertainment. I have had a Gameboy Advance (and SP) and a Nintendo DS for some time. So I do know the joy of games like Hotel Dusk (room 215) and many other Nintendo approved games.

But the truly mobile game, is the one you have always with you, one that&#8217;s either in your mind (I can do that) or, more interesting for you, on my cell phone (celly, mobile, handy, GSM, fill your preferred name here). I came to this whole deal from a developers perspective (Google Android is hot, J2ME is getting usable) and saw the potential. However, I can&#8217;t seem to find the quality titles. I&#8217;ve now bought The Simpsons and Might&Magic, I&#8217;ll try them out over the next few days. But at first glance, the only thing on my mind is &#8220;pfew, luckily those weren&#8217;t â‚¬50 like regular games&#8221;. Both were marketed as &#8220;adventure&#8221;, but sadly, both involve much button mashing. My old fingers were disappointed.

Maybe some one should port the free scrum vm to J2ME. Maybe some one already has? &#8230; hmm &#8230; let me check that out.
