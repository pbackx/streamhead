This week&#8217;s independent game is not a Flash game per se, but there is a Flash client to easily play it. &#8220;<a title="play Violet online" href="http://jayisgames.com/games/ifiction/game/violet" target="_blank">Violet</a>&#8221; is the <a title="Results of the 2008 annual interactive fiction competition" href="http://www.ifcomp.org/comp08/results.html" target="_blank">2008 Interactive Fiction Competition winner</a> and with reason. I have been <a title="13 games" href="http://www.streamhead.com/13-games-ultimate-game-pc/" target="_blank">an interactive fiction fan</a> for a long time, and really appreciate the original ideas that can be found in many of those games. Violet is no different, <a title="Jeremy Freese's blog" href="http://scatter.wordpress.com/author/jeremyfreese/" target="_blank">Jeremy Freese</a> has created a neat little game with an extremely clever and funny interface.

As usual, you type in commands, but now the interface seems to have a will of its own. You should try it out to really understand it.

You can <a title="play Violet online" href="http://jayisgames.com/games/ifiction/game/violet" target="_blank">play it online</a>, but if you want a more customizable experience, go for <a title="Gargoyle: Interactive Fiction" href="http://ccxvii.net/gargoyle/" target="_blank">the Gargoyle interpreter</a> and <a title="Violet download" href="http://www.ifarchive.org/indexes/if-archiveXgamesXcompetition2008XzcodeXviolet.html" target="_blank">download the game</a>. The online playable version is provided by <a title="Jay is Games : casual games" href="http://jayisgames.com/" target="_blank">Jay is Games</a>, as you might have noticed, it is one of my main sources for great casual games. If you want even more games, you should definitely pay them a visit.
