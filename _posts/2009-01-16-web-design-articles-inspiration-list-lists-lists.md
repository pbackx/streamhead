If there&#8217;s one post that is certain to draw attention, it&#8217;s a list of resources. Especially things related to website design and creation. And now, we&#8217;re seeing the appearance of lists of lists: A summary of the best list posts. To continue this &#8220;meta&#8221; trend, I was going to do a list of lists of lists and be all existential about it.

But I&#8217;m not going to. I&#8217;m just going to point you to one list. One I think will help you design better websites. It&#8217;s one that has stuck with me for much longer than most lists out there, because I have been able to get a lot of value from it. It certainly isn&#8217;t the best list, it&#8217;s just a good list.

It offers a lot of articles on web design tricks (like CSS) but also many inspirational posts. It is already about half a year old, but I don&#8217;t think it has become outdated.
