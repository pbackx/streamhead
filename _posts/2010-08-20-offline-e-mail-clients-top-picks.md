I&#8217;ve been looking into mail clients lately. At work I use Outlook, and for my other mailing needs I have Gmail. Neither of these options are bad, but I&#8217;m also not too excited about both. So I&#8217;ve been looking around and found a few options and I&#8217;m now using a few. I can&#8217;t give you any definite judgment just yet, but here&#8217;sÂ  a list of what I found and liked.

<!--more-->Most e-mail clients have very similar functionality. I&#8217;m looking for a few things:

  * It should be able to handle large amounts of mail
  * Search and archiving should be as easy and quick as possible
  * I&#8217;d prefer it to be free
  * If possible, make it visually attractive

Based on those criteria, I&#8217;ve selected two candidates, Postbox is the one I&#8217;m currently trying out and I&#8217;ll switch to Thunderbird next week.

## Postbox

<a title="Postbox" href="http://www.postbox-inc.com/" target="_blank">Postbox</a> has its roots on the Mac and it shows in the interface. It&#8217;s very clean and functional. I also liked the almost automatic configuration, you fill in your e-mail address and password and it figures out your mail settings. I suppose this won&#8217;t work for all providers, but it worked flawlessly for my accounts. If you&#8217;re used to Gmail&#8217;s threading, don&#8217;t fear, Postbox has it too.

Postbox has both a free and a payable version. I&#8217;m currently trying the full version, but I&#8217;m not sure if they are worth the price.

One thing I think I&#8217;d find useful is a global inbox view. I couldn&#8217;t find this kind of view, but it might be lurking somewhere. Otherwise I haven&#8217;t really found much wrong with Postbox, so I&#8217;ll see how the trial continues.

## Thunderbird

<a title="Thunderbird" href="http://www.mozillamessaging.com/" target="_blank">Thunderbird</a> is Mozilla&#8217;s e-mail client. I&#8217;ve tried it a long time ago and wasn&#8217;t too impressed, but I have the feeling it deserves a new look. It took me some searching, but it appears Thunderbird also supports threading, so it seems to have very similar features as Postbox.

Thunderbird does have add-ons, which might be nice, I&#8217;ll have to check them out.

**update**: since I wrote this, I&#8217;ve been getting into Postbox (and liking it) and it looks like it is build on top of Thunderbird. Which means that it also supports the exact same add-ons that Thunderbird supports. Although this isn&#8217;t prominently displayed on their page, there is <a title="Postbox extensions" href="http://www.postbox-inc.com/extensions/" target="_blank">a section for compatible add-ons</a>.

If you have a different favorite offline e-mail client, please let me know and share your choice in the comments. I&#8217;d love to have some other options.
