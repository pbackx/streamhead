This is an atypical post, it&#8217;s not on Tuesday nor Friday and it&#8217;s not directly media related. But as always, I want to give you lots of stuff think about and thinker with. As announced yesterday, today is **<a title="Blog Action Day 08" href="http://blogactionday.org/" target="_blank">Blog Action Day</a>**, the day we discus **global issues**. This year, it&#8217;s **poverty**.

Now I must confess, if I had to rank <a title="Global Issues" href="http://www.globalissues.org/" target="_blank">global issues</a> myself, I wouldn&#8217;t put poverty on top. It would be near the top, but my personal top issue is **sustainability**. The more I think about it, though, the more it appears that many of those global issues are very closely related. My personal interpretation of sustainable living is phrased as a question: How can we live our lives, develop ourselves, enjoy our luxuries, and still leave the world a better place for the people that follow us?

Sounds a lot like erasing poverty would go a long way in answering that question, doesn&#8217;t it?

A more down-to-earth question is asked by the techie in me: How to fit **technology** into those issues. Obviously I&#8217;m widely supportive and enthusiastic about any new tech, especially web technology. But how is this helping the poor? The main idea I have found in this area, is that technology makes it easier to educate. Why give a fish to the poor when you can teach them to fish? While I don&#8217;t think it was not the success that the creator wanted, &#8220;<a title="One laptop per child" href="http://www.laptop.org/" target="_blank"><strong>One laptop per child</strong></a>&#8221; is a great and powerful idea. There is another part to that answer though.

Once you got the learning platform installed, you need to offer them something to learn. In this regard, too, &#8220;<a title="Content is king" href="http://www.akamarketing.com/content-is-king.html" target="_blank"><strong>Content is king</strong></a>&#8220;.

I&#8217;m not sure, but I think some kind of **YouTube for &#8220;basic skills&#8221;** would be an incredible idea. A <a title="Start cooking - step by step" href="http://www.streamhead.com/start-cooking-step-by-step-with-video/" target="_blank">startcooking.com</a> for growing food. <a title="Instructables" href="http://www.instructables.com/" target="_blank">Instructables</a> is a site that comes close. But it&#8217;s more of a geek gathering, not aimed at the poor. I believe sites on this topic are scattered, or maybe I&#8217;m just not involved enough (feel free to prove me wrong in the comments!).

There is however **a big sustainable living movement** going on. It is interesting to see how those sustainability gurus come full circle when they are <a title="Square foot gardening" href="http://www.squarefootgardening.com/html/body_how_to___.html" target="_blank">talking</a> about <a title="The Bountiful Container" href="http://www.amazon.co.uk/gp/redirect.html?ie=UTF8&location=http%3A%2F%2Fwww.amazon.co.uk%2FBountiful-Container-Maggie-Stuckey%2Fdp%2F0761116230%3Fie%3DUTF8%26qid%3D1222981328%26sr%3D8-1&tag=watje-21&linkCode=ur2&camp=1634&creative=6738" target="_blank">their</a> <a title="GRS - introdcution to square foot gardening" href="http://www.getrichslowly.org/blog/2007/04/21/an-introduction-to-square-foot-gardening/" target="_blank">gardens</a>. The goal is the same: learning people to feed themselves. It&#8217;s just a different path.

## Conclusion

A platform that unites all those information sources to fight poverty and live sustainable could be a very powerful weapon.Â  It should not be aimed at one particular demographic. In one way or another, every one is involved. People with means can reduce <a title="calculate your carbon footprint" href="http://footprint.wwf.org.uk/" target="_blank">their carbon footprint</a> (<a href="http://www.wwf.be/eco-footprint/nl/" target="_blank">Dutch version</a>, <a href="http://www.wwf.be/eco-footprint/fr/" target="_blank">French one</a>), while poorer people can become less dependent on outside help. It&#8217;s a win-win for all of us and the world.

How do you think technology can help eradicate poverty?
