[![10 Million Days of Wonder Online Games Contest](http://www.streamhead.com/wp-content/uploads/2008/01/10000000.jpg)](http://www.daysofwonder.com/en/index/ "10 Million Days of Wonder Online Games Contest")

As a hardcore videogame player, you might have missed the briefing. But I&#8217;m here to tell you: tabletop games are back. One of the more popular games is Days Of Wonder&#8217;s &#8220;Ticket To Ride&#8221; (some extensions are available). It has simple rules, especially compared to an average real time strategy videogame, for instance. But therein lies its beauty.

Even if you are seated with a bunch of people that have never played the game, they can join the fun. They probably won&#8217;t win the first few games, but I&#8217;m pretty sure they will enjoy it.

To round the circle, Days Of Wonder has released an online version of Ticket To Ride. It&#8217;s not as engaging as the real life version, but it is very addictive and helps you train for that next big match, which you certainly won&#8217;t loose this time! And if you hurry, you might be playing in the 10 billionth game and win your self the entire ticket to ride collection.

Go and have some fun.
