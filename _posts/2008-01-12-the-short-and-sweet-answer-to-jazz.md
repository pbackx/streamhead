This is going to be short. But it will be sweet.

I think I found a worthy station for my number two spot in the online radio station top 10 (that will be finished one day, I&#8217;m sure). It is [SKY.fm](http://www.sky.fm/)&#8216;s [Modern Jazz station](http://www.sky.fm/channel/playlist/jazz). The choice in music is excellent. John Coltrane does make a very regular appearance, as do Charles Mingus and many others. And the music has to be brilliant, because everything else is wrong about this station.

It is one of those random play-list stations, that are the norm today. As far as I know, they don&#8217;t have any shows. It is part of a huge chain of one-more-similar-than-the-other streams. And there is almost no community to speak of (there is a tiny bit of discussion in the forum). In short, it has no personality.

Yet, I&#8217;m considering to put it on my number 2 spot. The music is that good.
