As the New Year begins, it feels like the perfect moment to sit down and share what’s been going on. It’s been quite a while since my last post, and I wanted to take a moment to explain why—and to reflect on the past year.

Think of this as a year-in-review post. If you enjoy that kind of thing, you’ll find plenty more of them [right here](https://www.streamhead.com/category/on_streamhead.html).

## The Why

Surprisingly, my previous post was written near the end of 2021, about 3 years ago. And the post before that, was 
another one and a half year before that, in 2020. So, why did I stop writing?

The fact is, I didn't stop writing at all. I am writing in different places. The biggest reason why I did so, is 
because I felt the blog was a bit all over the place. My interests are quite diverse, and I felt that the blog 
became a bit of a mess. Just take a look at all the different things on [my now page](https://www.streamhead.com/now/) 
to get the idea.

However, I feel the pendulum has swung too far in the other direction. While all my content may be in the "right" 
location, it's on many different sites, none of which I control.

So one of my projects in 2025 is going to be to regain control. Although my plan will change for sure, I am going to
crosspost everything to my blog. Even if it is just a copy and paste, I'll have a backup, and it is in one place.

For now, I am going to ignore the issue of keeping content in sync. I may try to figure out an automated solution
later, but for now, I am going to do it manually.


## The Where

The first part of this, is figuring out where all my content is. I started to make a list, but I have a feeling I
will come back to it later to add other things.

### Active Side Projects

Right now, I have two pretty active side projects going on:

#### The LEGO Sorter

You can read the announcement on this blog [here](https://www.streamhead.com/3d%20printing/ai/2021/11/01/deep-learning-lego-sorting.html).
Over the years I have worked on it from time to time, and quite a bit the last few months.
Most of this work can be seen on [Github](https://github.com/pbackx/lego-sorter-pi/),
but I also run [a monthly newsletter about it](https://subscribepage.io/sorting-updates). Sadly, there's no easy way to
access the archives, but I am working on that.

#### Savvy Folders

I started [this project](https://www.savvyfolders.com/) in late 2024 because I had some extra time. It's the very example of scratching my own itch.
For now, I am the only and very happy user of it, but I've recently been making progress into making it public.

[My progress is on Indie Hackers](https://www.indiehackers.com/product/savvy-folders).

### Social Media

My usage of social media is limited, or so I thought. Here are the sites where I am still active.

#### Goodreads

Each year, I set myself a challenge of reading at least 12 books. Most of the time, I read more, sometimes I read things
I don't always consider "books" (technical books, comics, etc.). 
 
[I keep track of everything with short reviews on Goodreads](https://www.goodreads.com/user/show/37577599-peter-backx).

#### How Long to Beat

A guilty pleasure of mine is playing video games. I've been playing them for years, and I still both the old and many
of the new games.

I keep track of my progress on [How Long to Beat](https://howlongtobeat.com/user/peterfromm/). I also try to write a
review on the games I finish, but I don't finish that many games.

#### Mastodon

Finally, there is [my Mastoodon account](https://indiehackers.social/@peterb). I am a pretty passive user of it, but 
some periods, I manage to post regularly.

## The Next Thing

I think the above covers the major places where I am actively creating content. There's a few other places that I want
to back up, but I'll get to that later (eg. Twitter).

The next step is going to be to define categories and import the existing content. I am not really looking forward to 
this, which is why I am publicly committing to it. I hope that will give me the push I need to get it done and to get
this blog relevant again.
