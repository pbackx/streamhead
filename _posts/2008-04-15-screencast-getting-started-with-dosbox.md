<p class="update">
  <a href="http://youtu.be/W9VB75N9bfs">This screencast has been updated and improved. Check it out!</a>
</p>



I had a few things lying around I wanted to play with, so here is a screencast version of <a href="http://www.streamhead.com/?p=80" target="_blank">my previous post on DosBox</a>. I don&#8217;t have much to add, if you need more info it can be found over there. If you want a better quality version, please go <a href="http://www.showmedo.com/videos/video?name=2360000;fromSeriesID=236" target="_blank">watch the one on ShowMedo</a>.

I would like to add some things on the programs and technology used to create the screencast. If you want to make a screencast yourself, <a href="http://camstudio.org/" target="_blank">CamStudio</a> is the program you want. It offers an easy to use interface and many options. If you plan on using all the options, you might want to write down all the shortcuts on a paper, because it&#8217;s a bit overwhelming at first.

As far as <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Text_to_speech" target="_blank">text-to-speech</a> is concerned, I must say I was a bit disappointed. I last checked in on the technology when <a href="http://www.lernouthauspiesettlement.com/" target="_blank">Lernout & Hauspie</a> were still around and their most advanced application were pretty acceptable. However, listen to the voice in the video for yourself, it&#8217;s not very attractive. I was able to find two open source projects, <a href="http://freetts.sourceforge.net/docs/index.php" target="_blank">FreeTTS</a> and <a href="http://espeak.sourceforge.net/" target="_blank">eSpeak</a>, but both didn&#8217;t even reach that quality. So I ended up using the free version of <a href="http://http//www.naturalreaders.com/" target="_blank">NaturalReader</a>. Many of the for-pay products seem to sound better, but I&#8217;m not sure if I can trust the samples they put online. Are they doctored? The difference between them and the free stuff is very big.

And last but not least, I can&#8217;t really recommend any video editing software. I tried some free stuff, but really didn&#8217;t find anything worth mentioning. I ended up messing around in <a href="http://virtualdubmod.sourceforge.net/" target="_blank">VirtualDubMod</a> and <a href="http://audacity.sourceforge.net/" target="_blank">Audacity</a>. Both good programs, but not for non-linear video editing. Can any one help me out with some suggestions?
