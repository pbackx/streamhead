If you&#8217;ve been wanting to get your feet wet with Flash Lite, the Flash for mobile, now&#8217;s your chance. Adobe is bribing you with $100.000 to write a killer application for their mobile platform. <a title="Flash Lite Developer Challenge" href="http://www.flashlitedeveloperchallenge.com/" target="_blank">The Flash Lite Developer Challenge</a> will award 6 applications in 6 categories with $15.000 and pick one overall winner that gets $30.000. Do you need more reasons?

In all honesty, I&#8217;m not sure Flash Lite is going to be the next big thing. Mobile seems to be growing big, but it&#8217;s far from clear which platform is going to take home the users. J2ME has the largest user base, JavaFX is the new thing, IPhone apps are exploding and Android is doing well with technical minded people. Does Flash Lite have a future amongst all of this? Maybe it&#8217;s best to try it out and figure it out for yourself. That&#8217;s at least what I&#8217;m going to do (although I don&#8217;t plan on winning any competitions)

This news came to me via a fellow country man and Adobe evangelist, Serge Jespers. <a title="Serge Jespers' blog" href="http://www.webkitchen.be/2009/02/17/make-money-with-flash-lite-development/" target="_blank">Check his blog</a> for more Adobe news and tutorials.
