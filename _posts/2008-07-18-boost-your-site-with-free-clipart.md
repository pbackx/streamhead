There are <a title="Free vector resources" href="http://gofreeserve.info/archives/quality-vector-resources" target="_blank">many sites offering free clipart</a> (usually as vector graphics). Many have annoying pop-ups and banners, many are <a title="Beautiful, but useless to me, icon set" href="http://www.smashingmagazine.com/2008/06/20/smashing-royal-icon-set/" target="_blank">way too specific</a> to be useful to any one but that one or two guys out there. But if I&#8217;m looking for something particular, I have found the <a title="Open Clip Art Library" href="http://openclipart.org/" target="_blank">Open Clip Art Library</a> to be a very valuable resource. It is not very &#8220;browse friendly&#8221;, so you can go and just surf around a bit. You&#8217;ll just encounter a lot of junk. If you have something specific in mind, just search and you&#8217;ll be surprised how vast, detailed and qualitative the collection is.

I used <a title="Gerald G fast food clipart" href="http://openclipart.org/media/files/Gerald_G/5856" target="_blank">Gerald G&#8217;s great work</a> to spice up <a title="Recipes new style" href="http://www.recipebook20.com/" target="_blank">Recipe Book 2.0</a> a little. Yay for burgers.
