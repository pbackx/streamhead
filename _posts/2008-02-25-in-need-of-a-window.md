[Need one?](http://cgi.benl.ebay.be/ws/eBayISAPI.dll?ViewItem&item=300202140068) 

In other news, I managed to fix my phone. For €15 I got a set of Torx screw drivers and some contact cleaner. The screw driver set will be useful for many other projects and who knows when more contacts will need to be cleaned.

I pretty much followed the ideas and links in [this post](http://whistler.intelecasoft.com/how-to-repair-se-k750-joystick). Only, I got a can of contact cleaner with a little tube, no need for guitar picks or anything. My joystick is working like a charm, the only thing I couldn&#8217;t quite get right is the trigger button for the camera. I don&#8217;t use it that much, so, for now, I can live with it

The whole ordeal saved me +€200 (or any nice new cell phone) so not bad at all.
