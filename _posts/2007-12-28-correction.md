When you&#8217;re wrong, you&#8217;re wrong. And I&#8217;m not afraid to admit it.

The mobile version of Might & Magic, which I talked about a few days ago, turns out to be a surprisingly good game. Especially considering the fact that you can buy this thing for €3. It&#8217;s a must. Although it still isn&#8217;t an adventure, it is very playable. As you might guess, the usual mobile caveats apply. Yes, the screen is small, but the graphics are clear and crisp. Yes, the navigation is a bit awkward, considering that you will be playing with the numeric path on your phone.

But overall, the game is more than enjoyable. It can be played in short bursts. The colors are bright and shiny, the level design is up-to-par with comparable console or PC games. Compare it with the Legend of Zelda. It&#8217;s action, but there&#8217;s some amount of adventuring (puzzling) involved. Anyway, at €3 I don&#8217;t know what&#8217;s holding you back, [just try it](http://www.gameloft.co.uk/mobile-games/might-and-magic/) and see for yourself. This New Year, the family meal won&#8217;t be as boring as other years.
