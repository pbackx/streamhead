Everybody needs it, but how do you go from this:

To this:

Let me tell you. You need to be patient and vigilant. You need the patience of an owl, or some other very very patient animal. Wait for the building permit, wait for the building contractors, wait for materials, &#8230;

And if you&#8217;re not very careful, you will be fleeced. I was just researching those lovely sofa&#8217;s that I used in my [SketchUp](http://www.sketchup.com/) design. [Le Corbusier](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Corbusier)&#8216;s LC2 sofa&#8217;s. At [Amazon](http://www.amazon.co.uk/gp/redirect.html?ie=UTF8&location=http%3A%2F%2Fwww.amazon.co.uk%2FCorbusier-LC2-Style-Seater%2Fdp%2FB000XRPGLI%3Fie%3DUTF8%26qid%3D1197967032%26sr%3D11-1&tag=watje-21&linkCode=ur2&camp=1634&creative=6738) <img style="border: medium none  ! important; margin: 0px ! important" src="http://www.assoc-amazon.co.uk/e/ir?t=watje-21&l=ur2&o=2" border="0" alt="" width="1" height="1" />you can find them for £494.99 (about €691), at [Design Within Reach](http://www.dwr.com/designers/?designer_id=115) they charge you a whopping $6455 (about €4435), while [a local shop](http://www.dascaniodesign.com/stock/c2.htm) asks €1600.

The same goes with loans, raw materials, people, &#8230; So compare at least a few products. Don&#8217;t compare until you found the absolute cheapest. It will take you a very very long time, and the quality is probably going to suffer.
