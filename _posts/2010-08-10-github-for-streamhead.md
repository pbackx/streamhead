If you want to host some open source code, there are many many options. Going from the grand-daddy of all open source repositories SourceForge to some more unknown, like <a title="Streamhead's Coding Secrets Exposed" href="http://www.streamhead.com/coding-secrets-exposed/" target="_blank">Assembla</a>. But one host that has seen extreme growth over the last few years is undoubtedly <a title="GitHub" href="http://github.com/" target="_blank">GitHub</a>. It&#8217;s built on the Git system, which makes it incredibly easy to cooperate and exchange ideas in code. No longer is there a need to have dedicated teams working on a project. It&#8217;s all ad-hoc and social.

One of the suggestions I get a lot (and I love your comments and suggestions!), is to provide more complete code for some of the tutorials/samples I give. I usually only show small parts of a larger solution and let the other stuff as &#8220;an exercise to the reader&#8221;. Understandably, this doesn&#8217;t always communicate my solution very clearly. Some people just like to browse through existing code.

And you know, they are right. So, in the future, I&#8217;m going to try to provide some complete code. And I&#8217;m also going through some of my older, but popular, posts to enhance them with a clear code sample.

I choose GitHub for two reasons, first because it is something popular I&#8217;d like to get to know it and secondly because the way Git seems to handle branching and cooperation sounds really great (and I&#8217;d like to try that too).

IÂ  used a few sources to get started:

  * <a title="Getting Started with Git" href="http://refcardz.dzone.com/refcardz/getting-started-git" target="_blank">The refcard on Git</a> is an easy way to get quickly up to speed with Git. There&#8217;s an explanation of how it works and also a description of the two workflows you&#8217;ll most likely encounter when working with Git.
  * There are <a title="Converting from SVN to Git" href="http://gitready.com/beginner/2009/02/04/converting-from-svn.html" target="_blank">many tutorials</a> out there to convert you from Subversion, which is probably something almost any developer is familiar with by now.
  * And finally GitHub itself has <a title="Help.GitHub" href="http://help.github.com/" target="_blank">a treasure trove of guides</a> available on anything you&#8217;ll need.

After <a title="Installing git (Win/msysgit)" href="http://help.github.com/win-git-installation/" target="_blank">a little configuration</a>, I&#8217;m now all set to create my first GitHub project. <a title="pbackx's Profile - GitHub" href="http://github.com/pbackx" target="_blank">Coming soon</a> (I already have <a title="Github Badges" href="http://github-badges.heroku.com/badges/pbackx" target="_blank">my first badge</a>).
