We&#8217;re all lost in some way, but lets not talk about that problem for once. A favorite story device of many books, movies and especially games, is the abandoned world. You&#8217;re left alone, in many cases with amnesia, and the only option is to move forward and figure this thing out.

_Warning_: many time-consuming links ahead.

A few of my all time favorite games use this mechanic to get the game moving: <a title="MYSTerium" href="http://www.mysterium.ch/myst/myst_info_e.html" target="_blank">Myst</a> drops you with a very odd explanation in a &#8220;parallel&#8221; world. The only interaction is through books. <a title="Gamespot retrospective" href="http://www.gamespot.com/features/6109881/index.html" target="_blank">System Shock 2</a> sees you trying to figure out what happened on the spaceship. Again the only thing you see of the outside world are movies (from the past). <a title="Shock Texture Upgrade Project" href="http://shtup.home.att.net/" target="_blank">Don&#8217;t forget to take it up a notch before you do a replay</a>. <a title="Doom flashed" href="http://www.newgrounds.com/portal/view/470460" target="_blank">Doom</a> leaves you stranded alone on Mars (<a title="It plays Doom" href="http://cache.gizmodo.com/gadgets/images/itplaysdoom.gif" target="_blank">on virtually any system in the world</a>). The initial game didn&#8217;t really have much more story than that, the <a title="Doom 3 official site" href="http://www.doom3.com/" target="_blank">Doom 3</a> remake, again, has movies and transmissions. Only on very special occasions (if ever) do you get to see actual &#8220;living&#8221; people. If you want to <a title="Doomworld" href="http://www.doomworld.com/" target="_blank">freak out on Doom</a>, <a title="Doomed Speed Demos Archive" href="http://doomedsda.us/" target="_blank">try to get these speed runs running</a> (<a title="Doom speed run" href="http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=C25gyBZGihU" target="_blank">small preview on YouTube</a>).

But where was I? Clearly, the initial goal of this story device was an easy way out of a number of technical problems. There&#8217;s no need for Non Player Character (NPC) interaction. Take <a title="Halflife2.net" href="http://www.halflife2.net/" target="_blank">Half-Life 2</a> for instance, there&#8217;s a lot of AI needed to get your teammates to fight along with you, without them looking artificial or extremely stupid. <a title="Zork I: The Great Underground Adventure" href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Zork_I" target="_blank">Zork</a> just drops you in a labyrinth and the only creatures you see intend to kill you. <a title="Zork online" href="http://www.xs4all.nl/~pot/infocom/zork1.html" target="_blank">Zork can be played online</a>, but it&#8217;s worth it to go the extra mile and [run it locally](http://wurb.com/if/game/game/2) so you can save. If you want it a bit more uptodate, even Half-Life has it&#8217;s share of figure-it-out-on-your-own mods. <a title="Dear Esther mod" href="http://www.moddb.com/mods/dear-esther" target="_blank">Try this one</a>.

<a title="Zork I - the game" href="http://www.flickr.com/photos/61821783@N00/1682937238/" target="_blank"><img src="http://farm3.static.flickr.com/2101/1682937238_1fa274f2c7_m.jpg" border="0" alt="Zork I - the game" /></a>

No matter the origins of being left alone, it also happens to be a great premises. A start of an exploration and a story to unfold. You&#8217;re dropped somewhere and it&#8217;s all up to you.

BTW <a title="Another World" href="http://www.anotherworld.fr/anotherworld_uk/" target="_blank">a high-def version of Another World can be bought online for less than 10 bucks</a>. What&#8217;s holding you back?
