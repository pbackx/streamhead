I&#8217;ve never played the first episode of this game, but this second installment was the first game I spend cash on, this year. That&#8217;s telling a lot.

<a title="Azada: Ancient Magic" href="http://www.bigfishgames.com/download-games/3795/azada-ancient-magic/index.html" target="_blank">BigFish games&#8217; Azada: Ancient Magic</a> is hard to describe. It&#8217;s definitely a puzzle game, but it&#8217;s not Tetris or Bejeweled. It wraps all of its puzzles in short stories, beautifully animated. It gives of the vibe of <a title="One good adventure game" href="http://www.adventuregamers.com/article/id,84" target="_blank">a good old adventure game</a>, but with a little less storry. There&#8217;s no pixel hunting and all puzzles are complete. And the fact that the storry is tinner has the advantage that you can just dive in whenever you want.

It&#8217;s casual, it&#8217;s not too hard, it&#8217;s relaxing, I love it.
