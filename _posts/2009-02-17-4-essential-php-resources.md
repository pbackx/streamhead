If you do any kind of web development, you will run into PHP rather sooner than later. It is the basis for many of the most popular web applications, such as <a title="WordPress as a CMS" href="http://www.streamhead.com/wordpress-content-management-system-display-post-category/" target="_blank">WordPress</a> and <a title="JEE vs Drupal" href="http://www.streamhead.com/j2ee-drupal-apples-oranges/" target="_blank">Drupal</a>. So at some point you&#8217;ll need PHP knowledge. Whether it is to debug modules, expand their functions or program an entirely new plugin. To get you started, here are the 4 most valuable references you will encounter.

Yes, only 4 links will get you a very long way in your PHP development career. That&#8217;s much less than what you get in most lists, but I guess that just means how good they are.

  1. <a title="PHP Manual" href="http://www.php.net/manual/en/" target="_blank">The <strong>official PHP.net manual</strong></a> (available in multiple languages). Usually any kind of official site only has the shortest description of the language they can get away with. Presumably this is to sell more books. Not so with the PHP site. There is a very comprehensive manual and great reference.
  2. **<a title="Practical PHP Programming" href="http://hudzilla.org/phpwiki/index.php?title=Main_Page" target="_blank">Practical PHP Programming</a>** was originally a book, called &#8220;PHP in a Nutshell,&#8221; but it is also available online. For Free. It offers an overview of the entire language, with a bunch of very practical extras in between.
  3. As a third free book, <a title="InformIT: PHP 5 Power Programming" href="http://www.informit.com/store/product.aspx?isbn=013147149X" target="_blank">InformIT&#8217;s &#8220;<strong>PHP 5 Powering Programming</strong>&#8220;</a> is certainly a very worthy choice. Apart from the usual stuff, the **<a title="The PHP Extension and Application Repository" href="http://pear.php.net/" target="_blank">PEAR</a>** section is certainly worth your attention.
  4. When you&#8217;re done with the reading, you need a good development environment. While many people prefer to use a basic text editor, I like a little visual assistance. Opinions and personal choices will vary, but I really like the **<a title="NetBeans 6.5 IDE - PHP Development" href="http://www.netbeans.org/features/php/" target="_blank">NetBeans 6.5 IDE with PHP extension</a>**. <a title="NetBeans for PHP : weblog" href="http://blogs.sun.com/netbeansphp/entry/screancast_about_netbeans_php_ide" target="_blank">Here&#8217;s a nice screencast</a> to get you started.
