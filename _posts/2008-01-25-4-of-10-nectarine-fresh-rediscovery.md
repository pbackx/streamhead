The 4th place in the top 10 online radio stations is taken by [Nectarine](http://www.scenemusic.eu/). It&#8217;s a bit of everything, but mostly it&#8217;s fresh underground music by bedroom composers.

The style is all over the place, however the biggest chunck of the music is very electronic oriented. For instance, you will hear a lot of [chiptunes](http://chiptunes.back2roots.org/). An artform that has been lost in the years since the Commodore 64 was the computer in everybody&#8217;s home. There&#8217;s [a large underground movement](http://chiptunes.free.fr/) (I don&#8217;t really like the term, but oh well) on the Internet keeping this type of music alive. Check out the other links and especially [this one](http://www.chiptune.com/). The [Amiga](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Amiga) [interface](http://www.amiga.org/) is just brilliant.

Back in the days, Nectarine was closely linked to the demoscene, and especially Orange Juice. The Orange Juice portal has gone, but it has been replaced by a number of other sites where you can get to know the demoscene. [Pouet.net](http://www.pouet.net/) is probably the best starting point. A &#8220;demo&#8221; is a non-interactive audio-visual demonstration. If you want a really quick primer, [demoscene tv](http://www.demoscene.tv) will serve you video-taped demos. Keep in mind, though, that the picture quality of the actual demo is a lot better (just download one from pouet.net and run it on your machine to see the difference). If you still want to explore further, there&#8217;s [oZone 3D](http://www.ozone3d.net/)&#8216;s [demo forum](http://www.ozone3d.net/smf/index.php?board=8.0). There&#8217;s also a wealth of information available over there if you should want to start coding your own demo.

One last Nectarine thing I&#8217;d like to mention, is its community features. Obviously you can upload your own tracks, but the coolest feature is the voting. Once you&#8217;ve got some favorites, you can vote them into the station&#8217;s playlist. It&#8217;s all very interactive, experiment a little and you&#8217;ll see.
