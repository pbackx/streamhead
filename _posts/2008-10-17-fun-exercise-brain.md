You know how Brain Training is supposed to be a fun way to improve your IQ. For me, after about 5 minutes, the novelty wore off, and so did the fun. If you&#8217;re like me, don&#8217;t despair! Many <a title="BoardGameGeek - Gaming Unplugged Since 2000" href="http://www.boardgamegeek.com/" target="_blank">board games</a> offer 1000 times the fun, and just as much brain training. And now they&#8217;re online.

<a title="games.AsoBrain.com - Java based multiplayer games" href="http://games.asobrain.com/" target="_blank">AsoBrain brings two of the most popular board games to the Internet</a>. For free. And they run inside your browser, so no need to install anything. They aren&#8217;t supposed to use the trademarked originals, so keep it quiet, but Xplorers is <a title="The Settlers of Catan" href="http://www.catan.com/CMS/content/view/65/60/lang,en_US/" target="_blank">Settlers of Catan</a> in disguise and Toulouse has some remarkable similarities to <a title="Rio Grande Games" href="http://www.riograndegames.com/games.html?id=48" target="_blank">Carcassonne</a>.

Just like <a title="Best way to lose some time" href="http://www.streamhead.com/best-way-to-loose-some-time/" target="_blank">Ticket to Ride</a>, the rules might take some time to get used to if you haven&#8217;t played too many board games before, but once you&#8217;ve learned them, they are simple, but reveal a complex strategy game. Sadly, AsoBrain doesn&#8217;t do too well in the documentation-of-gamerules department. Luckily there&#8217;s the Wikipedia entry for both games (<a title="Settlers of Catan on Wikipedia" href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Settlers_of_catan" target="_blank">Settlers</a>, <a title="Carcassonne on Wikipedia" href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Carcassonne_(board_game)" target="_blank">Carcassonne</a>) and many many <a title="English manual for the Settlers of Catan" href="http://www.gamecabinet.com/rules/DieSiedler.html" target="_blank">user created pages</a>. A little Google will keep you busy all day.

Let me know if you are up for a game.
