I&#8217;ve been continuing my pursuit for <a title="GTA Chinatown Wars will keep you busy for the rest of the year" href="http://www.streamhead.com/gta-chinatown-wars-busy-rest-year/" target="_blank">GTA Chinatown Wars completion</a>. The game has really drawn me in and it gets better every time I play. I also tend to loose more and more time, which is a good thing. If you happen to have the game, but have put it aside, I must urge: give it another try. The controls take getting used to, but it will be so rewarding.

<a title="Grand Theft Auto Chinatown Wars FAQ" href="http://www.squidoo.com/chinatownwars" target="_blank">GTA Chinatown Wars FAQ lens.</a>

To extract at least something useful out of the whole experience, I&#8217;ve begun to document some of the questions I encountered and the answers I found (or didn&#8217;t, for some). I&#8217;ve wanted to try out <a title="Squidoo" href="http://www.squidoo.com/" target="_blank">Squidoo</a> for quite some time, so here is <a title="Grand Theft Auto Chinatown Wars FAQ" href="http://www.squidoo.com/chinatownwars" target="_blank">my GTA Chinatown Wars FAQ lens</a>. It doesn&#8217;t have the usual walkthrough you can find on pretty much any gaming site. This FAQ has questions that aren&#8217;t answered anywhere else, but that might be important for you to fully enjoy the game. Feel free to add extra questions.
