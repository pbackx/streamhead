One of my 2009 goals was to get to the bottom of **Twitter** and its users. What makes them tick? And why the hell is a service that only gives you 140 characters to express yourself so popular?

I&#8217;ve been experimenting a bit with Twitter myself. I am starting to understand **the power**, but I still have to find my voice. You can of course **<a title="Twitter / pbackx" href="http://twitter.com/pbackx" target="_blank">follow me</a>** to see my progress. I started by taking a good look at the users and what they expect to get out of Twitter.

There&#8217;s a lot of variety, but in general I found **5 types of users**:

  * Many users are there to **sell you something**, usually they **pimp their blog** or site. I&#8217;m not always sure of the added value. For instance, what&#8217;s the point of <a title="Twitter Contest: Win A Premium WordPress Theme" href="http://www.dailyblogtips.com/twitter-contest-win-a-premium-wordpress-theme/" target="_blank">a competition like this</a>?Â  why bother? I have much respect for Daniel Scocco, the author of the blog. He has excellent insights into online business. But I&#8217;m not sure I&#8217;d like to put an add in my Tweet for a chance to win a $30 product. If I really want to use the theme, $30 is not going to stop me.
  * Another type of Tweet I see a lot is **the link**. <a title="Looking for Mr. Goodtweet" href="http://blog.guykawasaki.com/2008/11/looking-for-m-1.html" target="_blank">Guy Kawasaki is one supporter of this approach</a>. He advocates that any Tweet should contain links. I&#8217;m not sure if this should be the only use of Twitter, but there are some very interesting people doing this. For instance, <a title="Twitter / retronauts" href="http://twitter.com/retronauts" target="_blank">the 1Up Retronauts</a>.
  * My preferred Tweet for now is those **sharing &#8220;insights&#8221;**. I mean that in the broadest sense possible. One I really like is <a title="Twitter / hotdogsladies" href="http://twitter.com/hotdogsladies" target="_blank">Merlin Man&#8217;s Tweet</a>. Although he is on a break now.
  * One of the most popular Twitter persona&#8217;s is **the chatter**. Sharing the life of their cat, their car and pretty much anything else. Their Tweet&#8217;s are very conversational and it&#8217;s sometimes hard to filter out the nonsense. <a title="Twitterranting: On Ego Pedestals and Auto Following" href="http://menwithpens.ca/twitterranting-ego-pedastels" target="_blank">Some claim this is the sole purpose of Twitter&#8217;s existence</a>. It&#8217;s sort of IRC all over again. I used to love it, until I noticed how many hours of my life went into it.
  * A more recent development is the appearance of **the big corp <a title="Shill - Wikipedia, the free encyclopedia" href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Shill" target="_blank">shill</a>**. At first you might not like them, but I&#8217;ve found at least <a title="Twitter / maxkerning" href="http://twitter.com/maxkerning" target="_blank">one which I think is interesting</a>. I&#8217;m not sure if you can call <a title="Twitter / MarsPhoenix" href="http://twitter.com/MarsPhoenix" target="_blank">the MarsPhoenix lander Tweet</a> a shill, but it&#8217;s worth a click in any case.
  * And then there are a few that **cannot be classified**. In many cases those are applications, like <a title="Twitter / DVDQuotes" href="http://twitter.com/DVDQuotes" target="_blank">the DVD quote quiz</a>.
