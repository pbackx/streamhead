2010 is almost here and I like to end 2009 with a clean slate. One of those slates that needs cleaning is my starred items in Google Reader. I tend to star everything that looks like it might be interesting. The idea is that I can back to it later when I have a little more time. One item I found on that list is <a title="gBlog: Playing Records with ActionScript" href="http://www.gskinner.com/blog/archives/2009/11/playing_records.html" target="_blank">gSkinner&#8217;s Flash applet that plays perfectly good MP3 files as if it were slightly damaged vinyl records</a>.

What&#8217;s even more interesting than the great funny little Flash toy, is the fact that Grant gives all details of how it was implemented in ActionScript. There&#8217;s no source, but by the time you&#8217;ve read the entire blogpost, you have enough information to create the thing on your own.

Lots of links to very useful resources if you want to play MP3 files in Flash and lots of little details on how to obtain different visual effects.
