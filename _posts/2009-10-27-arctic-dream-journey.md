When I started this blog, I used to feature a few &#8220;dream&#8221; items from time-to-time. Stuff that would be cool to have, but was out of my financial capabilities. I haven&#8217;t done this recently, because I&#8217;m a little more focused on what is within my means. However, <a title="Quark Expeditions - Wikipedia" href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Quark_Expeditions" target="_blank">Quark Expeditions</a> has tickled that part of my brain that wants the impossible (or at least things that require a certain dedication to get).

Since the early nineties, <a title="Quark Expeditions" href="http://quarkexpeditions.com/" target="_blank">Quark Expeditions</a> has organized trips to the arctic and antarctic regions. They have their own, fully customized, &#8220;cruise ships&#8221; that are adapted to the regions weather. Basically you&#8217;re cruising on a fully equipped ice breaker, including a helicopter for side trips.

The voyages are all-inclusive, heli trips to watch penguins, zodiac missions, expeditions on the ice, etc. Basically it&#8217;s an adventure of a lifetime that allows normal people to discover a world that is otherwise only accessible by scientists or truly hardened adventurers.

In return, you pay the price. Short expeditions start at about $4000, but their latest offering, the truly epic <a title="Enf of an Era" href="http://quarkexpeditions.com/end-of-an-era" target="_blank">&#8220;End of an Era&#8221;</a> expeditions are $14000 and up. Is it worth it? I&#8217;m not sure, but personally, I tend to think &#8220;oh yes!&#8221;.

Can I pay the price for admission? Hell no.
