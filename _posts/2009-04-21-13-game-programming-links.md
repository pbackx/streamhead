I&#8217;ve mentioned a few indie games during my blogging days. Most recently, World of Goo last week. However, playing all those games, might have put a killer game idea in your head and have given you an appetite to become an indie developer yourself. In this posts, there are **13 links to get you started in game development**. It&#8217;s focused on getting started, but I&#8217;m sure **even the more advanced developer will certainly find something worthwhile**.

## <!--more-->Open source games

Those links serve 2 things: they will get you interested in what is possible. And if you are looking for a solution to a particular problem, you might find it in the code of those projects. Not all projects have good documentation, so real beginners might want to skip the code (but not the games!)

<a title="The official OpenArena website" href="http://www.openarena.ws/" target="_blank"><img class="alignnone size-full wp-image-1231" title="OpenArena" src="http://www.streamhead.com/wp-content/uploads/2009/04/openarena.jpg" alt="OpenArena" width="300" height="225" /></a>

<a title="The official OpenArena website" href="http://www.openarena.ws/" target="_blank">OpenArena</a>

This is actually a &#8220;data pack&#8221; for the open sourced Quake 3 engine (see link below). But I thought I&#8217;d put it in to give you a taste of what you can accomplish even if you know very little about programming.

[<img class="alignnone size-full wp-image-1232" title="ioquake3" src="http://www.streamhead.com/wp-content/uploads/2009/04/ioquake3.png" alt="ioquake3" width="300" height="231" />](http://ioquake3.org/)

<a title="ioquake3" href="http://ioquake3.org/" target="_blank">ioquake3</a>

Without the original Quake3 data files, you won&#8217;t be able to do much with the files you will find on the site. A number of years ago, the Quake 3 engine was open sourced by ID. Since then, the guys at ioquake3 have been working on that code. Improving and expanding it to become the reference Quake 3 platform. OpenArena above is one thing you can do with it, but you can also take it and build something entirely new. It doesn&#8217;t even have to be an action game. The world is yours.

[<img class="alignnone size-full wp-image-1233" title="vega_strike" src="http://www.streamhead.com/wp-content/uploads/2009/04/vega_strike.png" alt="vega_strike" width="300" height="188" />](http://vegastrike.sourceforge.net/)

<a title="Vega Strike" href="http://vegastrike.sourceforge.net/" target="_blank">Vega Strike</a>

Just look at those screenshots. Impressive! It&#8217;s open source and judging by the amount of mods that are available, it&#8217;s also easy and popular to build on.

[<img class="alignnone size-full wp-image-1236" title="java_shoot_em_up_prototyp" src="http://www.streamhead.com/wp-content/uploads/2009/04/java_shoot_em_up_prototyp.png" alt="java_shoot_em_up_prototyp" width="300" height="188" />](http://fabiensanglard.net/Prototyp/index.php)

<a title="Shoot 'Em Up with LWJGL" href="http://fabiensanglard.net/Prototyp/index.php" target="_blank">Shoot &#8216;Em Up</a>

This is actually not an entirely finished game, but it already looks wonderful. Most importantly, this is a Java open source game. So if you&#8217;re affraid of diving into game development because you don&#8217;t want to learn C or C++, that excuse is now void.

## Tutorial sites

<a title="Killer Game Programming in Java" href="http://fivedots.coe.psu.ac.th/~ad/jg/" target="_blank">Killer Game Programming in Java</a>

If you prefer, <a title="Amazon.co.uk: killer game programming in Java" href="http://www.amazon.co.uk/gp/product/0596007302?ie=UTF8&tag=watje-21&linkCode=as2&camp=1634&creative=19450&creativeASIN=0596007302" target="_blank">also available on paper</a>.

[<img class="alignnone size-full wp-image-1238" title="nehe" src="http://www.streamhead.com/wp-content/uploads/2009/04/nehe.png" alt="nehe" width="300" height="85" />](http://nehe.gamedev.net/)

<a title="NeHe Productions" href="http://nehe.gamedev.net/" target="_blank">NeHe Productions</a>

It isn&#8217;t updated as much as it used to be, but it&#8217;s still the reference to get started with OpenGL and to learn all advanced features.

<a title="flipcode Archive" href="http://www.flipcode.net/archives/" target="_blank">flipcode Archives</a>

No longer maintained, but the archive is so valueable, I just have to mention it.

[<img class="alignnone size-full wp-image-1240" title="game_programming_wiki" src="http://www.streamhead.com/wp-content/uploads/2009/04/game_programming_wiki.png" alt="game_programming_wiki" width="300" height="112" />](http://gpwiki.org/)

The number of links here is endless. You might not even need any of the other sites.

## Miscellaneous graphics resources

[<img class="alignnone size-full wp-image-1246" title="computer_graphics_resources" src="http://www.streamhead.com/wp-content/uploads/2009/04/computer_graphics_resources.png" alt="computer_graphics_resources" width="300" height="66" />](http://kesen.huang.googlepages.com/)

<a title="Resource for Computer Graphics" href="http://kesen.huang.googlepages.com/" target="_blank">Resources for Computer Graphics</a>

If you&#8217;re looking for inspiration on the graphics front, this is the site to get a taste of the getting edge. There are links to a large number of papers published at many leading computer graphics conferences. This is the stuff that will take a few more years before you see it in games. So now is the time to jump on that wagon.

[<img class="alignnone size-full wp-image-1247" title="openrt" src="http://www.streamhead.com/wp-content/uploads/2009/04/openrt.png" alt="openrt" width="300" height="98" />](http://openrt.de/)

<a title="RealTime RayTracing Project" href="http://openrt.de/" target="_blank">RealTime RayTracing Project</a>

The holy grail of graphics programming is certainly realtime raytracing. Picture perfect images are incredibly hard, so check out OpenRT to get a taste of it.
