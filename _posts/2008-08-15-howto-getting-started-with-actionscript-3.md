In all my eagerness to cover more <a title="3D in ActionScript" href="http://www.streamhead.com/?p=74" target="_blank">advanced ActionScript 3 topics</a>, I might have missed the obvious. If you really want to program ActionScript, there are a few important steps to take. Like actually learning the basics of object oriented programming.

If you already have a background in, for instance, Java or .Net, you are already well on your way to AS mastery. In that case, go take a look at <a title="ActoinScript 3 Workshop Slides" href="http://gskinner.com/talks/as3workshop/" target="_blank">Grant&#8217;s slides for an ActionScript 3 workshop</a> (<a title="AS3 workshop slides are now searachable" href="http://www.gskinner.com/blog/archives/2008/07/actionscript_3.html" target="_blank">searchable</a>). It contains 167 slides, full of ActionScript info. It is somewhat focussed on developpers wanting to upgrade from ActionScript 2 to 3, but it will help you tremendously, even if you don&#8217;t have any ActionScript knowledge.

Also, don&#8217;t forget <a title="ActionScript trace statement" href="http://www.streamhead.com/?p=115" target="_blank">the usefulness of the trace statement</a>.

_Note_: Dear reader, I usually don&#8217;t bother you with blog housekeeping information, but here&#8217;s the plan for the coming month(s). I will keep posting 2 posts a week, on Tuesday and Friday. Fridays will mostly focus on an interesting link with some commentary (such as this post) and on Tuesdays I will go more in-depth on a particular subject that I find interesting at that time. As always, you are all invited to send me your feedback.
