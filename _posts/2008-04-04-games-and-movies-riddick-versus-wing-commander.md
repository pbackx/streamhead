Just as Wing Commander wanted to be a movie (<a href="http://www.streamhead.com/?p=12" target="_blank">previous post</a>), so the Riddick franchise wanted to be a game. Both struggle with their identity, none obtain that true balance and are both a good game and a good movie.

At its height, <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Wing_Commander_%28franchise%29" target="_blank">the Wing Commander series</a> were hugely popular and loved by many, but the movie failed to make any kind of impression, not even with the fans.

[Pitch Black](http://www.imdb.com/title/tt0134847/) on the other hand, was dark and moody. It was for a niche audience, but that audience adored the movie. It never was big when it was released to theaters, but once on DVD it became a sleeper hit. And as those things go, a sequel was due. And together with the sequel, some one decided they also wanted a game.

A wonder happened, the game was brilliant. [Everybody](http://www.gamerankings.com/htmlpages2/921671.asp) <a href="http://www.gamespot.com/pc/action/chroniclesofriddick/index.html" target="_blank">loved</a> it. Oddly enough, the sequel itself wasn&#8217;t all too spectacular. It wasn&#8217;t bad, but it failed to meet most peoples expectations. It appears a great game and movie just don&#8217;t match.

[There&#8217;s another game planned](http://www.riddickgame.com/us/index.html) and according to the Internet Movie Database there are scenarios for 2 more movies. So maybe it will happen one day. Until then, lets play the game and movies just one more time.
