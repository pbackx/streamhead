Modeling your new house and/or rooms in SketchUp is only step 1 of getting a good impressions of what they will look like. This blog posts explains part 2: Adding lights and textures to get a good impression of what the space will look like when the lights are turned on. You&#8217;ll need 3D rendering software to accomplish this.

<a title="More fun with free 3D tools - Materials" href="http://www.streamhead.com/more-fun-with-free-3d-tools-materials/" target="_blank">It&#8217;s been a while since I mentioned IRender&#8217;s SketchUp plugin</a>. In the meantime they have released a few new versions. The most important improvements are the fact that lights no longer have that large and annoying cone when displayed in SketchUp. You&#8217;ll know what I mean if you ever tried it out in the past. I think it&#8217;s much better now. Also the rendering seems to have improved. This is probably because they improved shadows and changed the default view angle for spotlights. It&#8217;s certainly worth <a title="IRender nXt" href="http://wiki.renderplus.com/index.php?title=IRender_nXt" target="_blank">another look</a>, if you were not convinced in the past.

I will have to <a title="Peter Backx's 3D rendering portfolio" href="http://www.streamhead.com/model/" target="_blank">update my gallery</a> in the near feature to reflect those new changes.

If you want other free options, but once you&#8217;re used to SketchUp they might feel clumsy, there&#8217;s <a title="blender.org" href="http://www.blender.org/" target="_blank">Blender</a> and <a title="3D Modeling Software - trueSpace" href="http://www.caligari.com/" target="_blank">trueSpace</a>. However, if you want to model more organic forms, they might be a better fit (but beware the somewhat steeper learning curve)
