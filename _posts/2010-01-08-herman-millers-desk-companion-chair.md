Herman Miller releases a new desk that fits your body like a glove. Just make sure you also buy the chair. Based on your bodies anatomy, Herman Miller has been producing chairs that support you in just the right places. One of the main selling points of this rather expensive chair, is that it also adapts the support points when you lean back or sit upright. Up until now, the problem was that the desk didn&#8217;t move with you. But now there is the <a title="Herman Miller Envelop Desk" href="http://www.hermanmiller.com/Products/Envelop-Desk" target="_blank">Envelop Desk</a>.

Once upon a time, I was going to use this blog to post all kinds of incredibly expensive gear that I would never be able to buy, but that looked extremely cool. The plan never materialized, mostly because I tend to be a lot happier if I pretend that stuff doesn&#8217;t exist. But from <a title="Revoxx multiroom systeem" href="http://www.streamhead.com/the-consumers-dream/" target="_blank">time</a> to <a title="Ultimate game PC" href="http://www.streamhead.com/3-ways-obtain-ultimate-game-pc/" target="_blank">time</a>, a few <a title="Sony Vaio P" href="http://www.streamhead.com/sony-vaio-p-stylish/" target="_blank">things</a> slip through the <a title="Arctic voyages" href="http://www.streamhead.com/arctic-dream-journey/" target="_blank">cracks</a>.

Mostly I post the few exceptions, because they are, in fact, exceptional and I really plan to own them at some point in my life (unlike that Lamborghini that&#8217;s just not very practical for every day use, let alone the environment). The Herman Miller furniture is also such an exception.

$1000+ for a rather small desk seems overpriced, just like their chairs. That is until you understand the research and thinking that goes into those pieces, it becomes apparent why you might not mind paying that much for something that&#8217;s at least a 100 times more expensive than Ikea.
