I just purchased the <a title="iPhone Monkey Island Special Edition on sale" href="http://www.joystiq.com/2010/09/17/iphone-monkey-island-special-edition-1-and-2-on-sale/" target="_blank">two Monkey Island games that are on sale for the iPhone right now</a>. They are currently 99 cents each. They are also brilliant adaptations, so you should get them right away. It got me thinking if and how one is to make a living out of selling 99 cent applications. It&#8217;s something I have been thinking about, but after my very rough analysis, I don&#8217;t think I&#8217;ll be choosing that career.

<!--more-->I can understand how the creators of Monkey Island make a lot of money. The game was there, they &#8220;just&#8221; took the game and ported it to the iPhone platform. They did it perfectly. The mouse interface has been elegantly replaced with a pointer and default double click action to speed up adventuring. LucasArt might also going to reuse the code to port other games, so there&#8217;s an economy of scale here.

But how does an independent developer do? Well, I tried to guesstimate what developing a very smallscale adventure game might cost you. Basically I started from a situation where you already had a pretty good idea of the game itself, ie. you had the story pretty much figured out and most of the mechanics.

From there, I calculated 2 weeks for developing the concept and a prototype to figure out if the game was feasible. If this is your first iPhone game, you&#8217;d probably need 10 times the time. From this forward, I think 2 months development time will be the absolute minimum. Furthermore you&#8217;re going to need graphics, sound and possibly music. Graphics are usually what sell iPhone applications, so I wouldn&#8217;t try to cut corners there. You might be able to get away with a little less effort on the sound.

I put this data in a Google Spreadsheet to get an idea for the numbers:

If you want to actually make money with an iPhone app, you&#8217;re either going to have to be very lucky and become popular, or you&#8217;ll need to launch an additional marketing effort to get about 45000 buyers. Not an easy feat.
