My mind tends to wander from one project to the next. Which means, most of my projects are fairly small and I tend to forget about posting them here. I've recently been trying to show them off on YouTube using short videos. Here are two I posted in the last month: A home-built robot connected to AWS RoboMaker and SageMaker and a simple storage solution for a wooden puzzle.

## Robots

I've long been fascinated by robots. I've built a few smaller ones and from time to time come back to them to improve them or try something new.

When [devpost was holding an AI challenge](https://awsmarketplaceml.devpost.com/), it was time to rebuilt the robot one more time.

Links to get you started:

* [Robotshop](https://www.robotshop.com/) has a nice selection of robot-related materials. Another option I use regularly is AliExpress.
* [ROS](https://ros.org/) is somewhat of a standard in the robot world. It can run on a Raspberry Pi and is quite easy to get into. However, it feels like the community is getting split by the release of ROS2.
* Conveniently, it's also what [AWS RoboMaker](https://aws.amazon.com/robomaker/) uses (ROS 1, not 2)
* RoboMaker has "native" support for a number of robots, so if you want to buy a pre-built one, the [TurtleBot3](https://www.turtlebot.com/) seems to be a good choice. It's quite expensive, but, as I expand my own robot, I'm starting to realize, it's not overpriced.

## 3D Printing

Initially I was using my 3D printer to print all kinds of junk that was fun to show of and next it would end up in the trashcan (*cough* fidget spinners *cough*). 

I'm now mostly using it for things I actually need and can use. You'll notice the robot above has a 3D printed camera holder (not designed by me BTW).

Learning to design 3D objects is probably the best thing you can do if you have a 3D printer. It allows you to quickly test out a solution for even the smallest problem you have, such as this one:

Some links if you want to know more:

* [Fusion 360](https://www.autodesk.com/products/fusion-360/overview) is one of the better design packages out there for things like this. I'm not happy about the license, which is sort-of free, but could change any day. The only somewhat feasible open source alternatives I have found are [OpenSCAD](https://www.openscad.org/) for small parametrized designs or [Blender](https://www.blender.org/) which comes with a huge learning curve and which I don't particularly like for technical designs.
* I'm still happy with my [Ultimaker 3](https://ultimaker.com/) printer, but looking at the other options out there right now (for instance, the Prusa printers), it's probably not the best one for small hobbyist makers at this time.
* If you want these kinds of puzzles, there's really only one source out there: [Puzzle Master](https://www.puzzlemaster.ca/) (sadly in Canada, which makes shipping to Belgium very expensive)
