More zombies, more fun. BlendoGames, the creators of the previously <a title="We need more Gravity Bone" href="http://www.streamhead.com/gravity-bone/" target="_blank">very favorably reviewed Gravity Bone</a>, have just released a new full game. <a title="Atom Zombie Smasher" href="http://www.blendogames.com/atomzombiesmasher/" target="_blank">You can get Atom Zombie Smasher right now from their websites</a>. There&#8217;s even a demo if you&#8217;re not totally convinced yet.

<!--more-->Atom Zombie Smasher is not easily defined. It has some tower defense elements, it has a lot of real-time strategy and to complete it, there is some role-playing. Your mission is to evacuate as many people from a city that is run over by zombies. You&#8217;ve got a helicopter to get them out and a number of weapons and tactics to keep the zombies away.

Sounds simple, but mix it with tons of style and you get an explosive game that is above all addictive.

If that isn&#8217;t enough, Blendo Games is fully supporting the modding community. Currently you can mod pretty much any parameter in the game and upload your creations to the central repository.

I love how Blendo Games always manages to go in completely different directions, but they still take their very distinctive style with them. The result is a very different and entertaining look at existing genres.

<a title="Atom Zombie Smasher" href="http://www.blendogames.com/atomzombiesmasher/" target="_blank">Atom Zombie Smasher is only $15, so what are you waiting for?</a>
