Last week I hinted at <a title="Aptana Studio 2, IDE for the web" href="http://www.streamhead.com/aptana-studio-an-ide-for-the-web/" target="_blank">my renewed interest in JavaScript and IDEs</a> and here&#8217;s the result <a title="Play with the Last.fm API" href="http://www.streamhead.com/technology/Last.fm.play/#track.getSimilar" target="_blank">a playground for the Last.fm API</a>. I wanted to try out Last.fm&#8217;s API and what better way than write a little application. Some time ago I was really impressed with <a title="4 times Java(Script) in the news" href="http://www.streamhead.com/4-times-java-javascript/" target="_blank">Google&#8217;s Code Playground</a> so I wanted try my hand at it.

<!--more-->I&#8217;m pretty happy with the result. The application currently only has 2 examples but I didn&#8217;t want to hold it back until I finished them all. It also doesn&#8217;t have syntax highlighting and the layout will probably break in a few browsers (tried it on Firefox and Chrome)

So it&#8217;s far from perfect, but the entire code is fewer than 40 lines. Which I find amazing. It could probably fit comfortably on about 15 lines and still be fairly readable. I keep being impressed by the power of JavaScript and the libraries that are freely available.

Let me know if you find this useful. I have a few other API&#8217;s I&#8217;d like to showcase, but I&#8217;d first like to see how useful other people find this.

So try out my <a title="Play with the Last.fm API" href="http://www.streamhead.com/technology/Last.fm.play/" target="_blank">Last.fm API playground</a>.
