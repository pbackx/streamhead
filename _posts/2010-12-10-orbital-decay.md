Ever since my brief Shattered Galaxy stint I&#8217;ve been loving the whole custom spaceship battling game. You get an empty hull and lots of options of how to fill it. The trick is the select a good combination of defensive and offensive weaponry. If you like this kind of puzzling, you&#8217;ll love the two games in this post.

<!--more-->First of, there&#8217;s 

<a title="Gratuitous Space Battles" href="http://www.positech.co.uk/gratuitousspacebattles/" target="_blank">Gratuitous Space Battles</a>. Although this game might look like an action game, there&#8217;s absolutely no action gaming involved whatsoever. Don&#8217;t tell me I didn&#8217;t warn you. The game is about setting up a space fleet. You have virtually unlimited choices, which kind of makes it hard to get into at first. When you&#8217;ve tinkered with your fleet for a few hours you send them to battle.

This is where your involvement ends. It&#8217;s all on autopilot from here on. You can watch the battle to get a feel of how your options influence your ships efficiency. You don&#8217;t get to change anything though. So if you don&#8217;t like how it turns out, you have to restart.

The game is available on Steam if you want.

If you&#8217;d like a little action added to the mix and you don&#8217;t like paying for games. <a title="Orbital Decay" href="http://www.pirongames.com/index.php/arcade/play/1" target="_blank">Orbital Decay</a> is your game. It has less options, but there&#8217;s still a bunch. And you have one cannon (the main one) you can control. You can choose to go for a mostly auto-piloted game or you can start shooting away yourself. Or both. The choice is yours.

You&#8217;ll need a little time to find a strategy that fits you, so I suggest you start on easy. It might be a little too easy, but the normal difficulty level will probably kick your ass the first few times you try it.

BTW I&#8217;m joining the Steam treasure hunt, so if you have a Steam account, feel free to <a title="Steam Community: Peter" href="http://steamcommunity.com/id/pbackx" target="_blank">friend me</a>.
