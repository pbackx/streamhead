In my final post in the casual game series, I present <a title="Fault Line" href="http://www.nitrome.com/games/faultline/" target="_blank">Fault Line</a>. The basic mechanic is that of an action game. You move your avatar through a 2D side scrolling world. Jump from one platform to the other. The final goal: reaching the &#8220;end&#8221; marker. There&#8217;s no story or reason given why you might want to reach the end, other than that you can. But it won&#8217;t be easy.

Because there&#8217;s a twist.

<!--more-->This is where the puzzle part of the game enters the scene. Using some kind of fancy weapon, it is possible to slice parts away from the screen. You can&#8217;t do this trick just anywhere. There are several &#8220;connection&#8221; points where you can start or end a slice. Combined with lots of lasers, moving platforms and various other death traps, the end result is a puzzle game that will keep you very entertained for a good time.
