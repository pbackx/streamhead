Before we really get started in the New Year, here is a final look back at another great casual game of 2009, called <a title="Graveyard Shift" href="http://www.nitrome.com/games/graveyardshift/" target="_blank">Graveyard Shift</a>. While <a title="Avalon game" href="http://www.streamhead.com/avalon-fairy-tale-relax-discover/" target="_blank">Avalon</a> was all relaxation, Graveyard Shift is about adrenaline. It&#8217;s a rail shooter in Flash.

While the nighttime landscape scrolls from right to left, zombies and their brethren show up and try to kill you. Your mission is to shoot them before they hurt you.

At first you might think Graveyard Shift will become repetitive very soon, but the game manages to regularly throw new things at you. New enemies, different weapons and its biggest trick: a shield. You can shield of attacks, but you have to time it right. It takes a while to get used to, but it breaks up the shooting nicely.

My only minor critic is the fact that you can&#8217;t full-screen the game. It certainly is possible (YouTube does it), but I haven&#8217;t seen a full screen option in any flash game. Maybe it&#8217;s because the banners have to remain visible at all times?
