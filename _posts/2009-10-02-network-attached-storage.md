Now that my new office is starting to come together, I have begun research into ways of storing all my files in a central location on the network. This has several advantages: they can be used from every device that is connected to my home network and I only have to backup one device.

What I want is a NAS, or Network Attached Storage device. There are literally hundreds of devices available and if you&#8217;re not convinced by that choice yet, you can just build your own machine and put <a title="FreeNAS: The Free NAS Server" href="http://www.freenas.org/" target="_blank">a Linux distro</a> on it or go the <a title="Windows Home Server" href="http://www.microsoft.com/windows/products/winfamily/windowshomeserver/default.mspx" target="_blank">Windows Home Server</a> route. <a title="Build a Cheap and Fast RAID 5 NAS" href="http://www.tomsguide.com/us/cheap-fast-diy-raid-5-nas,review-779.html" target="_blank">Tom&#8217;s guide has a nice overview if you want to add RAID</a>.

One thing that I worry about, is the power consumption of such a device. It will be on 24/7, but I will probably only use it for a small part of that time. I couldn&#8217;t find much information about it, but I think this is where a dedicated device could shine. So here are some interesting links about devices built to be NASes:

  * <a title="Network Storage Devices" href="http://arstechnica.com/hardware/reviews/2005/09/nas.ars" target="_blank">Ars Technica review of two popular NAS options</a>
  * The <a title="Linksys NSLU2" href="http://www.linksysbycisco.com/US/en/products/NSLU2" target="_blank">Linksys NSLU2</a> is great if you want to <a title="NSLU2-Linux" href="http://www.nslu2-linux.org/" target="_blank">hack your device</a>.
  * The <a title="ReadyNAS" href="http://www.readynas.com/" target="_blank">ReadyNAS range of devices</a> is a very popular choice if you want something that just works.
  * And finally, <a title="Het grote NAS overzicht topic" href="http://gathering.tweakers.net/forum/list_messages/1226678" target="_blank">Tweakers has an enormous overview of available devices</a>. It&#8217;s in Dutch, but the tables are comprehensible by any one.

Feel free to share your suggestions and tips in the comments.
