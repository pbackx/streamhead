If you&#8217;ve been keeping up with the blog via your browser, this post is for you. There are many other and sometimes betters ways that you might not know about. And those ways don&#8217;t just work for this blog, you can use them pretty much on any site and reduce the time it takes you to browse through your favorite sites.

<!--more-->If you&#8217;ve never heard about RSS, or have always thought it&#8217;s something technical, not for you. Now is the time to change that. RSS is basically a newspaper of all the blogs you like, delivered to your door, every day.

There are many programs that support RSS. For instance, I like <a title="Google Reader" href="https://www.google.com/reader/" target="_blank">Google Reader</a> because it&#8217;s online and always available. You can add subscriptions to websites you like to visit frequently. From that point on, updates to the site will automatically appear in Google Reader, right next to all the other sites you like. No need to open 100 bookmarks, it&#8217;s all in one place.

If you open <a title="Streamhead RSS feed" href="http://www.streamhead.com/feed/" target="_blank">the <strong>Streamhead RSS feed</strong></a>, you&#8217;ll get a lot of other options. Another example: I really like <a title="NetNewsWire for iPhone" href="http://www.newsgator.com/individuals/netnewswireiphone/default.aspx" target="_blank">NetNewsWire on my iPod Touch</a>. It allows me to quickly catch up to the latest news, wherever I am.

I&#8217;m going to be honest, it takes a little getting used to, to follow your sites outside of their homepage, but it allows for a lot more flexibility.

But sometimes, you like something simpler without the need to set up a new account or install programs. That&#8217;s when an e-mail subscription might be perfect for you. Many sites, such as this one, offer e-mail lists with the latest news and sometimes a little extra. If you like, you can set up a filter in your e-mail program of choice to keep your inbox from flooding.

The **Streamhead e-mail signup is located to your right**, just under the search and category box. Just fill your e-mail address in the box and you&#8217;ll automatically start receiving the latest news every week, straight to your inbox. Give it a try, if you don&#8217;t like it, it&#8217;s really **easy to unsubscribe**.
