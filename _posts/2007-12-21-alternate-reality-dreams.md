I love [alternate reality games](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Alternate_reality_game), I was a sucker for [Perplex city](http://www.perplexcity.com/) and put way too much money into buying those missing cards.

The [Isis adventure](http://www.isisadventure.be/) ([uk site](http://www.isisadventure.co.uk/)) seems just as fun. But why do they have to make it [so bloody expensive](http://www.amerone.be/index.html?lang=nl&target=d141.html&lmd=39437.414491)? Almost $200 to enter a game that you&#8217;re probably not going to win. Because, lets be honest, the chances are slim that you are able to compete against some of those geeks that live for this kind of stuff. Little note: I&#8217;m not using &#8220;geeks&#8221; in a pejorative way here, I find it unbelievable how committed some people are, I just can&#8217;t put so much energy in one single thing.

The brilliant thing about Perplex city was that you didn&#8217;t really need to win. You could enjoy it, even if you knew there was no chance of ever winning the thing. Most of the puzzles were cool and kept you thinking and searching. I wonder if this Isis puzzle is like it. I must say, for the same amount, I can almost buy a Wii, that&#8217;s some though competition.
