<a title="economics of $0.99 iPhone apps" href="http://www.streamhead.com/economics-of-iphone-apps/" target="_blank">Ever since I started playing Monkey Island on my iPod Touch</a>, I&#8217;ve become more and more convinced that the mobile platform is the future of adventure games. A good adventure game has been compared with reading a book. And with reason, a good adventure game&#8217;s backbone is a brilliant story. Now we can finally, comfortably take that adventure game into our lazy recliners, away from technology and boring desks.

<!--more-->I currently don&#8217;t own an Android device and I haven&#8217;t seen a good adventure game for my Nintendo DS since 

<a title="Mobile games" href="http://www.streamhead.com/mobile-everywhere/" target="_blank">Hotel Dusk: Room 215</a> (let me know if you know more!), so I went looking for iPod Touch compatible adventure games.

I found quite a few.

If you like text adventure games, there is absolutely no excuse not to have <a title="iphonefrotz" href="http://code.google.com/p/iphonefrotz/" target="_blank">iphonefrotz</a>. It&#8217;s free, and it supports enough games to last you a few lifetimes. It&#8217;s the most relaxed way to play text adventure games yet. I love it.

But lets get back to point and click games. This <a title="iPhone/iPod touch adventure game list" href="http://www.adventuregamers.com/forums/showthread.php?t=23710" target="_blank">iPhone/iPod touch adventure game list</a> is the most complete I found. It&#8217;s a bit spread out over the topic, but you&#8217;ll get a bunch of great ideas. It appears many developers are cashing in on their older games. For instance, Simon The Sorcerer is also available. Judging from some of the screenshots, I&#8217;m not sure if all developers took as much time to refine the interface as the Monkey Island creators did.

Revolution seems to be one big exception. Judging from the information I found, their latest <a title="Broken Sword DC iPod" href="http://www.revolution.co.uk/isword.php?id=102" target="_blank">Broken Sword director&#8217;s cut</a> looks like it will be worth your money. It contains the old storyline and adds an entirely new parallel one. I&#8217;ll certainly be looking into buying this one when I complete both Monkey Island games currently on my iPod.

But what about original content? I find it pretty hard to get an idea of what&#8217;s out there. <a title="1112 The Game" href="http://www.1112game.com/" target="_blank">1112 looks very interesting</a>. And there are some more, but I&#8217;ll have to get back to you on that when I find the time to evaluate them a bit further.

I&#8217;d love to hear your input. Have you found an exceptional portable adventure?
