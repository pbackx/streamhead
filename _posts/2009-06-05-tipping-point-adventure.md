Adventures don&#8217;t have to be about pixel hunting or Knight Templars. <a title="Tipping Point adventure game" href="http://www.tippingpointgame.com/" target="_blank">Tipping Point</a> proves that adventures can be different. Although that might be a reason why some people would like to call it a puzzle game instead of an adventure. But it has all the ingredients I like in an adventure: a weird story and lots of puzzles to solve.

The game starts in your couch, but soon goes to different places. All puzzles are pretty logic, but that doesn&#8217;t mean they always make sense from an outsider point of view. Oddly enough, inside the setting of the game, they seem to make sense none-the-less. Which is cool.

The gorgeous prerendered graphics and gameplay immediately bring back memories of <a title="Myst Worlds" href="http://www.mystworlds.com/" target="_blank">Myst</a>. The adventure/puzzler that started the whole multimedia revolution to begin with. Which is even cooler.

Absolutely recommended.
