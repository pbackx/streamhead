It seems like every one is doing it these days: tilt-shift photography. The technique has existed, probably, since photography. But it has been rediscovered just last year.

If you want to do the &#8220;real&#8221; thing, you need a pretty expensive camera. You need a special lens and you need a lot of patience to set up the lens just right. So obviously, many tutorials have appeared on the net, explaining how to fake it in some graphics program (usually Photoshop).

But if even that is still too complicated or cumbersome for you, there is now an even more convenient solution: <a title="tiltshiftmaker.com" href="http://tiltshiftmaker.com/" target="_blank">tiltshiftmaker.com</a>.

Cool stuff, too bad it will probably be a little too much work to create <a title="Tilt shift faking" href="http://www.streamhead.com/tilt-shift-fakery/" target="_blank">a movie</a> with this tool.
