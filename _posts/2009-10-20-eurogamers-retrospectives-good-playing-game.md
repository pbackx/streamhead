For a while, <a title="Retro games @ Eurogamer" href="http://www.eurogamer.net/retro/" target="_blank">Eurogamer</a> has been featuring reviews of old games. For marketing reasons, they call them retrospectives. I hear you wondering, what&#8217;s so special about reviews for age old games? Well, that probably means you&#8217;re either too young to know the games, or have too much time on your hands and can play through all those games.

If you&#8217;re like me and <a title="The pile of shame" href="http://www.streamhead.com/time-managing-pile-shame/" target="_blank">you&#8217;re short on time</a>, you will love those 5 to 10 minutes reads. They offer an in-depth look at what made those games great, what was so very wrong about them and how they have held up over time.

I know, I know, it&#8217;s the perfect excuses for more procrastination.

Here are a few of my favorites (and which I still have to play):

  * <a title="Star Wars Jedi Knight: Dark Forces II" href="http://www.eurogamer.net/articles/retrospective-star-wars-jedi-knight-dark-forces-ii-article" target="_blank">Star Wars Jedi Knight: Dark Forces II</a>
  * <a title="Space Quest IV" href="http://www.eurogamer.net/articles/retrospective-space-quest-iv" target="_blank">Space Quest IV</a>
  * <a title="The Dig" href="http://www.eurogamer.net/articles/the-dig-retrospective" target="_blank">The Dig</a>
  * <a title="Vampire: The Masquerade" href="http://www.eurogamer.net/articles/retrospective-vampire-the-masquerade-bloodlines" target="_blank">Vampire: The Masquerade</a>

The memories &#8230;
