Customizing an operating system has always been popular. There are many tools and many preconfigured styles out there. <a title="Stylish add-on for Firefox" href="https://addons.mozilla.org/en-US/firefox/addon/2108/" target="_blank">Stylish</a> is the same thing, but for websites. <a title="Restyle the web with Stylish!" href="http://userstyles.org/" target="_blank">On its companion site Userstyles.org you can find hundreds of pre-build styles for many websites</a>. There are many pointless Facebook styles and gimmicky changes, but between those lie the pearls that are really worth checking out.

<!--more-->Basically Stylish applies custom CSS style sheets to the websites you specify. For some reason I thought the option to specify personal styles had always existed in browser (and Firefox in particular), but I couldn&#8217;t find much information on it. In any case, Stylish makes adding new CSS sheets extremely easy. It also has a few style management functions that allow you to select if and when CSS files should be active.

Two styles I&#8217;m currently trying out and which I really like are:

  * <a title="Gawker Blogs - Minus Garbage Plus Width" href="http://userstyles.org/styles/33542" target="_blank">Gawker Blogs &#8211; Minus Garbage Plus Width</a>: If you&#8217;re following <a title="Google Reader shared items for Peter Backx" href="https://www.google.com/reader/shared/peter.backx" target="_blank">my Google Reader shared items</a>, you might have noticed I&#8217;m a pretty faithful Gizmodo reader. While I like many of their articles (especially the longer, more thought out ones), I hate their design. This custom style is a godsend if I want to go and check out the comments on the site.
  * <a title="Google Reader simple and clean" href="http://userstyles.org/styles/17120" target="_blank">Google Reader simple and clean</a>: Google Reader is already a fairly minimalist application, but this style goes even further. Only try this if you like white and pure content.

Feel free to share your favorites in the comments. I&#8217;d love to discover some other ones.
