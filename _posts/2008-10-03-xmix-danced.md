All X-Mix videos available for your viewing pleasure! See below.

Ah, &#8220;the good old days,&#8221; when music still felt new and not &#8220;been there, done that.&#8221; One of many treasured memories is the early nineties, when we witnessed how the masses discovered electronic music, how they adopted it and changed it to their world view. Me, I was on a search for &#8220;real&#8221; electronic music, not 2 Unlimited. And I found it on long-forgotten radio stations and on MTV. Saturday nights started with the Party Zone and the discovery of great music and annoying hosts.

And then it happened. Up till X-Mix videos, most clips were either blueprints of existing patterns or very primitive computer animations. X-Mix was different. It was an hour long mix, with high quality visuals, a lot of computer generated 3D. It was my first encounter with this kind of stuff, that would eventually lead to me creating <a title="DTV :: All the demoscene on a web TV!" href="http://www.demoscene.tv/" target="_blank">demos</a>.

It&#8217;s rather pointless to try to describe the mixes, you have to see and hear them, experience them. There were 10 X-Mix &#8220;longvideos&#8221; made in total:

Thanks to the wonders of YouTube, I can give you a preview of all those mixes (<a title="sushigroove profile page" href="http://www.youtube.com/user/sushigroove" target="_blank">sushigroove</a>, <a title="Revenant7605 profile" href="http://www.youtube.com/user/revenant7605" target="_blank">revenant7605</a> and <a title="EmpiemaBack YouTube profile" href="http://es.youtube.com/user/EmpiemaBack" target="_blank">EmpiemaBack</a> we love you for your hard work). Only X-Mix 4 and a few parts from 9 are missing in action. Can any one help out?



The quality of most of those videos is pretty low. The source is usually a VHS tape of the MTV program, and, well, this is YouTube after all. If you want high quality videos, you can still buy the DVD collection from <a title="!K7 Records" href="http://www.k7.com/" target="_blank">the !K7 Records site</a>. The entire X-Mix archive fits on 3 DVDs. It&#8217;s only missing the Ken Ishii mix, because that one was released seperatly. â‚¬19.99 for each DVD, a very reasonable price, in my humble opinion.
