I&#8217;m a sucker for a good puzzle. And among the puzzles, those that use the simplest mechanic to create the most complicated puzzle are my favorites. <a title="Play Grid" href="http://www.candystand.com/play/grid" target="_blank">Grid</a> is such a game. While its name is probably the least original and worst marketing move one in history, the game itself is the complete opposite.

<!--more-->A simple mechanic: rotate pipes, form a network. But there&#8217;s a twist: only blocks that are powered up which are connected to the main network can be rotated. Sounds easy, but through 35 puzzles you&#8217;ll learn that the puzzles it creates are seriously twisted.

<a title="Play Grid" href="http://www.candystand.com/play/grid" target="_blank">Play Grid</a> but beware the &#8220;just one more&#8221; effect.
