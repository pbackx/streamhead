The beauty of the Internet is that every one can be famous. Create something great and they will come (with a little social marketing). Take for instance <a title="branit|vfx_World Builder" href="http://www.branitvfx.com/worldbuilder/index.html" target="_blank">World Builder</a>. A short movie by Bruce Branit. In a world without Internet, you wouldn&#8217;t even know this movie existed, but now it can be shared freely.

And what a marvel it is. An incredible two years in the making, this movie deserves to be seen by any one and every one.

The Internet doesn&#8217;t stop there, to show your appreciation you can <a title="Facebook | World Builder" href="http://www.facebook.com/pages/World-Builder/73936485659" target="_blank">become a fan</a>, discuss the movie and get to know the latest news.

But first, enjoy the movie.
