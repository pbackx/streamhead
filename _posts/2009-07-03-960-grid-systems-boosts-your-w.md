If you&#8217;re designing a website, or especially if you are programming it. You want to quickly layout the different components of your application. Or you might be tired of always implementing a nice column layout and even be tempted to reach back to those tables of yore.

Fear not, there is now an easy ways to take care of that boilerplate code. It&#8217;s called <a title="960 Grid System" href="http://960.gs/" target="_blank">the 960 Grid System</a>. <a title="More fun with free 3D tools - materials" href="http://www.streamhead.com/more-fun-with-free-3d-tools-materials/" target="_blank">I&#8217;ve previously mentioned it in passing</a>, but I thought it did merit it&#8217;s very own post. There&#8217;s only one downside to the system: the resulting webpage has a fixed-width layout. If you can live with that, the 960 System will increase your productivity by amounts you didn&#8217;t think possible. If you can&#8217;t live with that, you might want to look into some of the derivatives, such as <a title="Fluid 960 Grid System" href="http://www.designinfluences.com/fluid960gs/" target="_blank">the fluid system</a>.

If you start using the system, <a title="6 Trips and Tricks for Designing with the 960 Grid System" href="http://blog.centresource.com/2009/06/15/6-tips-and-tricks-for-designing-with-960/" target="_blank">Jason at CentreSource has some tips for you</a>.
