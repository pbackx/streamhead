Life philosophy is not the main topic of this blog, yet if you want to **reach any goal**, like media presence or technological innovation or both, you need to **think** about what it is you do, what your goals are and how to reach them. Marketing and innovation are two terms that are laden with a lot of theory and many quacks selling empty promises. Many books have been written, but **a new wave of young entrepreneurs thinks they can do it differently**.

**Chris Guillebeau** is one of them and he has the stats the back it up. Most of what he does is free. He even actively tries to **persuade you not to buy his products**. And it&#8217;s not a cheap reverse psychology trick. There are others, like Steve Pavlina, Scott Young and a bunch more. However, Chris strikes the right chords with me. He leads the life practically every one has dreamed about.

His mission is to visit all the world&#8217;s countries and he is already halfway there. Judging by his blog, it won&#8217;t take long before he has seen the other half. And how does he do it? He simply writes about what he does, why he does it and how. It&#8217;s like John Chow without the adds.

**His marketing plan**: just **be yourself** and in his case that means being disruptive. Seth Godin probably loves it.

I don&#8217;t think every one will actually want to travel the world, but I do believe his philosophy is right: do what you like and worry about the money later. Last month he released a **<a title="279 Days to Overnight Success" href="http://chrisguillebeau.com/3x5/overnight-success/" target="_blank">blueprint for success</a>**. <a title="The Secret Formula for Overnight Success" href="http://chrisguillebeau.com/3x5/the-secret-formula-for-overnight-success/" target="_blank">It&#8217;s not for every one</a>, but it&#8217;s probably for you if you are still reading this post. And best of all, it&#8217;s entirely **free**.
