There are many ways to market your product. You might want to try and <a title="13 Resources to Get Started in Game Programming" href="http://www.streamhead.com/13-game-programming-links/" target="_blank">create a small game</a>. If done correctly, free games can have a pretty major reach. But if that&#8217;s a bit too complicated or expensive, why not keep it simple and create a small and enjoyable &#8220;real&#8221; toy. Enter <a title="Cubeecraft - Free Papercraft Toys" href="http://www.cubeecraft.com/" target="_blank">Cubeecraft</a>.

The Cubeecraft site offers a number of nice paper models. You can print them out and put them together yourself. Most (all?) models don&#8217;t require any glue, just a little patience. The result is a funny character you can give away or place on your desk.

[<img class="alignnone size-full wp-image-1255" title="Bomberman white" src="http://www.streamhead.com/wp-content/uploads/2009/04/176a.png" alt="Bomberman white" width="107" height="155" />](http://www.cubeecraft.com/cubee/bomberman-white)

Obviously, the prime audience would be children. Add a drawing contest or just give them the blank template and the results would probably surprise any one. Other people who love this kind of stuff are geeks and crafters.

I also wonder if this idea could be applied to <a title="Boomerang" href="http://boomerang.be/" target="_blank">those post cards you find in different places</a>. I&#8217;m not sure if those can be found in other places then Belgium, but they are made of pretty sturdy material and I think they would end up with the right kind of people. Usually a younger, college crowd who have way too much time on their hands (been there ðŸ˜‰ ) and would show this of to friends.

## Other uses

Obviously, if you&#8217;re a crafter or just looking for something small to liven up the room, there are much much worse ways to spend your time then to print out a few designs and spend some time putting them together.

<a title="Cubeecraft templates" href="http://www.cubeecraft.com/blog/submission-guidelines/" target="_blank">You can even create some of your own designs</a>.

And if the design was a bit more simplified, it might even be a killer business card for a designer.
