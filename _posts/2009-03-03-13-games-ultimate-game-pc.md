Last week, I talked about the ultimate game PC. However, to play a **good game**, **you don&#8217;t need to spend lots of money**. You can load up a casual game and be entertained just as much as any &#8220;real&#8221; and &#8220;hardcore&#8221; game could. Casual games are usually a little less deep and they revolve around a simple gameplay mechanic. But they are great at entertaining you in small chunks. And lately, **15 minutes** is all that I have to play games. Here they are.

## Physics games

&#8230; they&#8217;re all the rage now.

<img class="alignnone size-full wp-image-1042" title="grayonphysicsdeluxe" src="http://www.streamhead.com/wp-content/uploads/2009/02/grayonphysicsdeluxe.png" alt="grayonphysicsdeluxe" width="300" height="188" />
  
<a title="Crayon Physics Deluxe" href="http://www.crayonphysics.com/" target="_blank">Grayon Physics Deluxe</a>

$19.95, but so worth it.

<a title="99 Bricks" href="http://www.kongregate.com/games/WeirdBeardGames/99-bricks/" target="_blank">99 Bricks</a>

It&#8217;s a kids game. Even a toddlers game, because, that&#8217;s what they love to do. Stack stuff on top of each other until it falls over. Here&#8217;s your chance to relive that moment. As with many games in this posts, it&#8217;s extremely addictive because, your next game will certainly be a little better!

<a title="IncrediBots" href="http://incredibots.com/" target="_blank">IncrediBots</a>

This is not only a game, it&#8217;s a complete sandbox environment. You have to see and experience it to believe that this is possible in Flash. As the name suggests, it&#8217;s incredible.

## Interactive fiction

&#8230; get yourself <a title="Gargoyle: Interactive Fiction" href="http://ccxvii.net/gargoyle/" target="_blank">Gargoyle</a> to play these games.

<a title="Final Selection - IFWiki" href="http://www.ifwiki.org/index.php/Final_Selection" target="_blank">Final Selection</a>

Find the word to get the job.

<a title="The One That Got Away" href="http://home.netcom.com/~leonlin/if/if.html" target="_blank">The One That Got Away</a>

A fishing game! It&#8217;s a book that you write yourself.

## Action Games

 <img class="alignnone size-full wp-image-1051" title="dogfight2" src="http://www.streamhead.com/wp-content/uploads/2009/02/dogfight2.png" alt="dogfight2" width="300" height="225" /><a title="Dogfight 2" href="http://www.rocksolidarcade.com/games/dogfight2/" target="_blank"></a>
  
<a title="Dogfight 2" href="http://www.rocksolidarcade.com/games/dogfight2/" target="_blank">Dogfight 2</a>

WW2 dogfighting action, with beautiful graphics.

## Puzzle games

<img class="size-full wp-image-1036 alignnone" title="griswold" src="http://www.streamhead.com/wp-content/uploads/2009/02/griswold.png" alt="griswold" width="300" height="200" />
  
<a title="Griswold the Goblin: Islands of Fire Chapter 1" href="http://griswold.the.goblin.islands.of.fire.1.fizzlebot.com/" target="_blank">Griswold the Gublin: Islands of Fire Chapter 1</a>

A real oldskool adventure. Although a bit short, it offers you everything you used to get from the Sierra and the likes. It starts out with a pretty frustrating puzzle with some pixel hunting. But keep going, there&#8217;s good fun to be had later on.

<img class="alignnone size-full wp-image-1039" title="electricbox" src="http://www.streamhead.com/wp-content/uploads/2009/02/electricbox.png" alt="electricbox" width="300" height="225" />
  
 <a title="Electric Box" href="http://www.candystand.com/play.do?id=18463" target="_blank">Electric Box</a>

Incredibly clever game. That last level took me a while, but it&#8217;s so satisfying when you figure it out.

## Commercial games that run on any hardware

Lands of Lore

<a title="How to get your nostalgic game fix" href="http://www.streamhead.com/how-to-get-your-nostalgic-game-fix-and-also-so-long-home-of-the-underdogs-rest-in-peace/" target="_blank">Previously</a> <a title="Screencast: getting started with DosBox" href="http://www.streamhead.com/screencast-getting-started-with-dosbox/" target="_blank">mentioned</a>, might be difficult to find but certainly worth a little trouble.

<img class="alignnone size-full wp-image-1053" title="beneathasteelsky" src="http://www.streamhead.com/wp-content/uploads/2009/02/beneathasteelsky.png" alt="beneathasteelsky" width="300" height="216" />
  
<a href="http://www.scummvm.org/downloads.php#extras" target="_blank">Beneath a Steal Sky</a>

100% free and still 100% playable. Be vigilant.

## Games that will drive you mad

&#8230; In a good way. <a title="Receiver IK" href="http://jayisgames.com/archives/2009/02/receiver_ik.php" target="_blank"></a>

<a title="Receiver IK" href="http://jayisgames.com/archives/2009/02/receiver_ik.php" target="_blank">Receiver IK</a>

Such a simple concept, you play a sort of 2 dimensional pong with yourself. Only, you don&#8217;t play with one ball, every 8 hits, you get one more ball. Until it turns into a frenzy.
