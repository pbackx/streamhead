You might not notice it, but this is the first post written on the 3.0 version of WordPress. The fact that you&#8217;re not noticing, is testimony for how smooth the upgrade went. Obviously I didn&#8217;t upgrade to keep the exact same blog. There are some big enhancements that will enable a bunch of ideas I&#8217;ve been wanting to implement.

<!--more-->It&#8217;s now possible (or at least, much easier) to customize how individual posts are displayed. You can define custom post types with a dedicated custom template. Or you can keep it a little easier with custom backgrounds and headers. It&#8217;s a feature you&#8217;re probably going to see here pretty soon.

There are also an extreme number of enhancements for developing themes and plugins. The list is so long, I&#8217;m going to have to take a day just to go through it and see what I might want to use.
