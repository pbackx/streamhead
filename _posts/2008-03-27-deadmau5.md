I needed something to match the new color scheme, so I present you <a href="http://www.deadmau5.com/" target="_blank">Deadmau5</a>. Canadian export at its finest. Before 2007, no one knew <a href="http://www.discogs.com/artist/Deadmau5" target="_blank">Joel Zimmerman</a>, but now he is progressive personified. If you want a taste of the good stuff, go check out <a href="http://www.myspace.com/deadmau5" target="_blank">his myspace page</a>.

Most of the time his music is not complicated, no endless layers. In that regard, he is part of the minimalism movement, but well, lets not play trainspotter for too long. I&#8217;d really like to hear an album by this guy to see how he does in that format.

Via [Resident Advisor](http://www.residentadvisor.net/feed-item.aspx?id=1020), I found [56 early tracks](http://www.deadmau5.com/deadmau5-56.zip). Neat.
