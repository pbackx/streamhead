The trend in gaming this year is certainly the rise of indie developers. One person or small teams that create incredibly good games with little to no budget. A trend, which might become popular in other avenues too. Design, music, news reporting, and many more can all be transformed into an indie equivalent.

The writing has been on the wall for quite some time. While big budget games have become terribly expensive, rivaling the budgets of Hollywood movies, indie games can be developed withing a reasonable budget. Therefor they tend to be profitable even if they don&#8217;t reach millions of people.

The iPhone store, XBox live and the Internet in general have become cheap venues that reach many thousands of interested gamers. Even the economic crisis might be in favor of many indie developers, as their games are usually much cheaper than most commercial games.

One brilliant example is <a title="World of Goo" href="http://www.worldofgoo.com/" target="_blank">World of Goo</a>, by <a title="2D Boy" href="http://2dboy.com/" target="_blank">2D Boy</a>. There&#8217;s a demo if you want to try it out.
