<a title="Hidden chapter 1" href="http://www.lostspell.com/hidden/hidden-chapter-1-primitive-essence.php" target="_blank">Hidden</a> is probably the most traditional adventure game I&#8217;ve featured in this series of game related posts. Adventure purists will be delighted. If you haven&#8217;t been playing adventure games since you were born, you might have a few gripes. Hidden has some of the pet peaves of adventure games, like pixel hunting and sometimes objects are only accessible via strange ways (you&#8217;ll understand when you see it). But do not let that distract you from this great game.

As always, <a title="Hidden chapter 1 walkthrough" href="http://jayisgames.com/archives/2008/12/hidden_chapter_1_primitive_essence.php" target="_blank">Jay is Games has a walkthrough</a> if you should get stuck, which is a bit more likely in this game than in the previous games I featured.
