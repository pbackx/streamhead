All packed an boxed.Â  Not [those colourful boxes](http://www.pingmag.jp/2007/03/01/japanese-cardboard-box-design/), though.

In between homes, I have selected to only keep my Nintendo things handy (GameCube, DS, Gameboy) and stuff all the other junk into large cardboard boxes. So expect a lot of [Feng Shui tips](http://flickr.com/photos/watje/253094926/) and [Courtroom battles](http://www.court-records.net/).

If you didn&#8217;t notice it already, it&#8217;s a great time to own a GameCube. You can pick up new games for almost nothing, if you are not too picky. The graphics might not compare to those of the latest consoles, but their quality hasn&#8217;t degraded in any way. [It even has Linux](http://www.gc-linux.org/wiki/Main_Page) if you feel like hacking.
