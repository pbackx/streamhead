Combining the virtual with the real, that&#8217;s what <a title="Introduction to geoblogging" href="http://www.problogger.net/archives/2008/04/15/geoblogging-how-to-geotag-your-blog/" target="_blank">geoblogging</a> and geotagging are all about. It&#8217;s really easy to add this stuff on any WordPress blog. Basically you follow along <a title="Introduction to geoblogging" href="http://www.problogger.net/archives/2008/04/15/geoblogging-how-to-geotag-your-blog/" target="_blank">the linked article</a> to get the required tags and your coordinates. Once that&#8217;s done, you could copy the tags directly into your template, but if you upgrade or change your theme, they will be lost.

It is easier to install <a title="WordPress header-footer plugin" href="http://wordpress.org/extend/plugins/header-footer/" target="_blank">the Header-Footer plugin</a> and use that one. Be careful! The plugin does not like special characters. If I copied the tags as is, there were different versions of <a title="Double quotes" href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Double_quote" target="_blank">double quotes</a> in there. That really screwed up the plugin. All my header and footer tags were lost and replaced by an &#8220;a&#8221;. So make sure you only use the normal quotes (for instance, don&#8217;t copy from Word).

Once that&#8217;s all done, you can enter your site on geourl and get a neat button, like this:

[<img src="http://i.geourl.org/80x15/simple.png" border="0" alt="GeoURL" width="80" height="15" />](http://geourl.org/near?p=http://www.streamhead.com "check out my neighbors in meatspace")

And if you want even more geo-fun, install <a title="GeoPress plugin" href="http://georss.org/geopress" target="_blank">the GeoPress plugin</a> and you can start geotagging your posts. The picture above was taken here:

NOTE: I&#8217;ve since removed the GeoPress plugin because it was using a bit too many resources. I plan on trying it again in the near future, so stay tuned.
