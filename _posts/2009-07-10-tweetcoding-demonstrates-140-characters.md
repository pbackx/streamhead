If you&#8217;re an ActionScript programmer and you haven&#8217;t checked up on <a title="#tweetcoding rules" href="http://gskinner.com/playpen/tweetcoding.html" target="_blank">#tweetcoding</a>, you owe it to yourself to take the rest of the day off and look it up. <a title="Twitter / Search - tweetcoding" href="http://twitter.com/#search?q=tweetcoding" target="_blank">#tweetcoding</a> is an ActionScript coding competition, organised by <a title="gBlog: News and views on Flash, Flex, and ActionScript" href="http://www.gskinner.com/blog/" target="_blank">Grant Skinner</a>, where you have exactly 140 characters (a tweet) to program something interesting.

You might think that this is an impossible mission, however, before you do so, take a look at the entries. There&#8217;s some astonishing things possible in just 140 characters.

It reminds me of those <a title="Pouet.net 4k intros" href="http://pouet.net/prodlist.php?platform[]=Windows&type[]=4k&order=thumbup" target="_blank">4kb intros</a> that were (and still are) created in the demoscene. It&#8217;s astonishing what people can do when faced within such small boundaries.

For instance check out Elevated (but you really should <a title="Elevated" href="http://www.rgba.org/webpages/prods.php?museo=0#51" target="_blank">download it and run it locally</a>)



It has sound and high-res visuals for crying out loud. And all of that in less than the size of even the most beepy ringtone you can find. Incredible.
