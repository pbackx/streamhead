Today I combine 2 new (sort of) hi-tech web services to reproduce the most outdated tech ever.

## Ingredients

  * **<a title="ccMixter" href="http://ccmixter.org/" target="_blank">ccMixter</a>**: a site that hosts mixes based on **Creative Commons** work. If you don&#8217;t know already, Creative Commons is a set of licenses (like copyright) that gives artists a bit more freedom. For instance they can choose to allow people to remix their songs for non-commercial purposes (that would be <a title="Creative Commons Attribution-Non Commercial" href="http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by-nc/3.0/" target="_blank">a by-nc license</a>). If you want the background behind the CC, I strongly suggest **<a title="The Future of Ideas" href="http://www.amazon.co.uk/gp/product/0375726446?ie=UTF8&tag=watje-21&linkCode=as2&camp=1634&creative=6738&creativeASIN=0375726446" target="_blank">Lawrence Lessigs&#8217; &#8220;The future of ideas&#8221;</a>**. It should be required reading for any one in the digital world.
  * <a title="Mixwit - Create and Share Digital Mixtapes" href="http://www.mixwit.com/" target="_blank"><strong>Mixwit</strong></a>: a web 2.0 service that allows you to enter a bunch of links to music and create a playlist. In return you get a nice interface to browse and play that list.

## The result

A good old-fashioned mix-tape! Even the little wheels spin (it&#8217;s reels isn&#8217;t it?).

_update_: Sadly, Mixwit is now out of service. So this mixtape is no longer accessible. You can get a little bit of the old feeling on <a title="Mixwit.Blog" href="http://mixwit.wordpress.com/" target="_blank">this Mixwit tribute blog</a>.

I know the picture is not entirely accurate. &#8220;libre&#8221; does translate to &#8220;free&#8221;, but only meaning &#8220;this cab is free&#8221; (as in &#8220;it has free places&#8221;). It cannot be used in the context of &#8220;free beer&#8221;. I believe the French would use the word &#8220;gratuit&#8221; in that case. I thought it was nice sign anyway.
