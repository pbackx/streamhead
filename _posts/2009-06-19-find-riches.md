In today&#8217;s get-rich-quick world, you can&#8217;t open your browser without some one trying to sell you an e-book on getting filthy rich in just hours. In all honesty, I have to admit, I never did buy such a book, so I can&#8217;t be sure, but if it is too good to be true, it usually is. So I was delighted to see <a title="The Legend of Luke Sidewalker" href="http://lukesidewalker.blogspot.com/" target="_blank">The Legend of Luke Sidewalker</a>.

His basic idea is popular enough: earn a million dollar. However he&#8217;s not in a hurry. His plan is to just pick up that million. Right on the sidewalk, people drop a lot of loose change and never bother to pick it up. Luke does and he&#8217;s going to be rich for it.

His quirky stories and penny map are a treasure to explore. For instance, I love <a title="Opposable opinions on generations" href="http://lukesidewalker.blogspot.com/2009/06/opposable-opinions-on-generations.html" target="_blank">his theory why cash is lying on the sidewalk</a>. Hours of fun and don&#8217;t you forget to pick up that penny.
