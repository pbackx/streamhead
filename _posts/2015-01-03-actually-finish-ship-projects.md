If you&#8217;re an entrepreneur or you want to be one, the most important roadblock to success is usually yourself. Although you may not know it, you sabotage yourself all the time. Amy Hoy&#8217;s &#8220;Just Fucking Ship&#8221; is here to help you back on the track.

[color-box]I read, view and listen to a lot of interesting information. To keep a record of what I learned, I&#8217;m going to organize these reviews around an important question asked and/or answered in the book. This post discusses [Just Fucking Ship by Amy Hoy](https://unicornfree.com/just-fucking-ship)[/color-box]

If you&#8217;ve followed Amy, you know there&#8217;s bound to be NSFW language, but there&#8217;s also going to be some awesome life lessons.

The first version of the book was written in 24 hours, using the 21 principles in the book to get it shipped by the deadline (that first version of the book only had 19 principles).

<img class="alignright wp-image-3770 size-medium" src="http://www.streamhead.com/wp-content/uploads/2015/01/keep-calm-and-get-it-done-11-257x300.png" alt="keep-calm-and-get-it-done-11" width="257" height="300" srcset="http://www.streamhead.com/wp-content/uploads/2015/01/keep-calm-and-get-it-done-11-257x300.png 257w, http://www.streamhead.com/wp-content/uploads/2015/01/keep-calm-and-get-it-done-11.png 600w" sizes="(max-width: 257px) 100vw, 257px" />It&#8217;s not a lengthy book, but the ideas within will give you a lot of pause to ponder and write things down. There are some things that you will undoubtedly already know (&#8220;Break it into pieces&#8221;), but it&#8217;s good to have a reminder for them all in one place.

Some of the principles that certainly struck a chord with me are the ones about preparation. &#8220;Work backwards&#8221;, &#8220;Mise en place&#8221; and &#8220;Choose your difficulty setting&#8221; are good reminders that you must know crystal clear (crispy) what the end goal is before doing the actual work.

Otherwise, you&#8217;re not going to make that deadline (another principle).

Another general theme was that it is vital to get stuff shipped as soon as possible and have that first contact with customers: &#8220;Start small&#8221;, &#8220;Every version better&#8221; and &#8220;Exploit the Pauli Principle&#8221;.

An excellent resource to have when you are starting a new project. And I&#8217;m waiting for some one to turn this into a poster that I can hang besides my desk.
