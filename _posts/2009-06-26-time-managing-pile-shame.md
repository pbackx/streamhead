The pile of shame might be unknown to you, but it seems like more and more people write about theirs. It is a pile of stuff (usually computer games) that you bought, but never played for more then a few minutes. Lately my pile is getting to monstrous sizes.

I have many top games lying around, for instance Bioshock. I have ordered it through Steam, but that&#8217;s about it. I also have many classic adventure games. Carefully collected over many years. However most remain unplayed. Compare to <a title="Your Unopened Game Pile of Shame" href="http://www.giantbomb.com/news/your-unopened-game-pile-of-shame/456/" target="_blank">most people that admit they have a pile</a>, mine is seriously out of control.

And lately I&#8217;ve been collecting also been collecting a pile of books (both fiction and non-fiction) and even some movies (but those are still manageable)

I need some time, like a year off. But don&#8217;t we all?
