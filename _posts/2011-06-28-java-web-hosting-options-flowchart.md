One question I get asked a lot, is where and how to host your Java web application. It&#8217;s all fine to create it inside Eclipse with an embedded server, but how do you get it to the people? For a long time, there was no answer for enthusiast programmers. There were only expensive and way oversized options. Things have changed lately, but it&#8217;s still not an easy choice.

Therefore I have created a small flowchart that will try to guide you in the maze.

Feel free to submit additions, corrections, comments. I&#8217;ll keep updating the flowchart.
