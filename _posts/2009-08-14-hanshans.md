Games based on cartoons. It seems like a match made in heaven. Yet only very few games manage to pull it off. <a title="Leaving Loki's Lockup" href="http://www.nick.com/games/hans-hans-leaving-lokis-lockup.html" target="_blank">Leaving Loki&#8217;s Lockup</a> does. It&#8217;s based on an up-and-coming Nickelodeon cartoon called <a title="Hans Hans - The Biking Viking" href="http://www.bikingviking.com/" target="_blank">Hans Hans, the Biking Viking</a>.

<p style="text-align: left;">
  Upon playing the game, I immediately thought of <a title="The Lost Vikings" href="http://www.mobygames.com/game/dos/lost-vikings" target="_blank">The Lost Vikings</a>. It&#8217;s an old DOS (and other platforms) puzzler game that gives you a team of Vikings that need to work together to obtain their goal. They each have their speciality.

<p style="text-align: left;">
  Just as The Lost Vikings, Leaving Loki&#8217;s Lockup involves Vikings working together. They are both nicely animated, funny and inventive.
</p>

<p style="text-align: left;">
  Leaving Loki&#8217;s Lockup does fall a bit short in the control department. They aren&#8217;t very fluid and it takes a bit getting used to. But once you know the quirks, this is another free casual game that&#8217;s very enjoyable.
