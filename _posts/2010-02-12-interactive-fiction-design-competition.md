As a lighter aside, here&#8217;s one more way to get into interactive fiction. The game-genre that has been going strong for 30+ years. <a title="Casual Gameplay Design Competition - Interactive Fiction" href="http://jayisgames.com/cgdc7/" target="_blank">JayIsGames, my favorite casual gameplay site, is holding an interactive fiction competition</a>. The goal was to create an &#8220;escape&#8221; themed interactive fiction game. The quality of the entries is excellent, and most definitely worth a look.

I&#8217;ve mentioned <a title="Violet, interactive fiction" href="http://www.streamhead.com/violet-interactive-fiction-game/" target="_blank">interactive fiction</a> a <a title="13 games that don't require the ultimate game pc" href="http://www.streamhead.com/13-games-ultimate-game-pc/" target="_blank">few times before</a>. So you may call me a fan of the genre. I love their relaxed pace and reliance on nothing more but the written word. I hate their, sometimes, frustrating puzzles or lack of vocabulary. If you use <a title="Gargoyle : Interactive Fiction" href="http://ccxvii.net/gargoyle/" target="_blank">Gargoyle</a> to play the games, you&#8217;ll almost feel like reading a book. Which is especially relaxing.

All of the games in the competition are programmed with <a title="Inform" href="http://inform7.com/" target="_blank">Inform</a> (I think that was a requirement). Inform allows you to program a game in an almost natural language. It&#8217;s an easy way for any one to get into programming games.
