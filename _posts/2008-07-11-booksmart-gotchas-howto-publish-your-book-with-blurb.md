I have been <a title="Indy guide" href="http://www.streamhead.com/?p=128" target="_blank">experimenting with Blurb&#8217;s service and their publishing tool</a>, called **BookSmart**. It allows you to arrange your photos and create your book in a user-friendly way. However, it is not a <a title="Dekstop publishing on Wikipedia" href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Desktop_publishing" target="_blank">desktop publishing (DTP)</a> tool, like Adobe InDesign or Microsoft Publisher. While it is very convenient, it is also limited. There were a few points I struggled with:

  * **Layout options are limited**. There is a large set of layouts to choose from, but that&#8217;s it. I don&#8217;t think you can define your own layout.
  * <img class="alignright size-full wp-image-156" title="Symbol used to connect two text frames in Microsoft Publisher" src="http://www.streamhead.com/wp-content/uploads/2008/07/connectpitcher.gif" alt="" width="27" height="30" />**Page flow is not clear**. If you copy-and-paste a large chunk of text, BookSmart will intelligently add pages with the same layout for you. It will also link those pages, so if you remove a few lines here and there, the text will autofill. However, at times those links get severed and this auto-layout no longer works. Sometimes you want to remove the link, but there&#8217;s no clear way to do it. I remember most DTP programs have a little icon that showed the link, and you could delete that. I couldn&#8217;t find anything like that in BookSmart. In the end, I cut op my book in small chapters, so that the autolayout could work on the chapter, but not on the whole book. That turned out to work pretty well.
  * When I did use pages with multiple text windows and changed the layout, it tended to just **drop the text**, which was probably the most annoying bit. There is an undo function, but if you don&#8217;t notice it right away, you might end up loosing important bits. I would suggest to author and store the text in another program and copy-and-paste it into BookSmart as needed.
  * Related to the previous point: **Always work from front to back**. If you change something in the first pages of the book, you risk messing up the layout of those that come behind.
  * In general: If you will **only** be publishing **pictures**, with very little text, I think BookSmart will be more than enough for your needs. As soon as you want to add more text (I&#8217;d say my case was 50% pictures, 50% text) it gets more complicated. The text editing tools are limited, for instance, there is no &#8220;justify&#8221; alignments options, that neatly fills the entire line.

In spite of those negative points. I must say, BookSmart was a truly **user-friendly** tool, that any one can just pick up and use. I got **friendly warnings** when I did stuff that might impact my book. The most important warning was when I used pictures with too low resolution. It&#8217;s also nicely integrated with the ordering process. And it&#8217;s **free**. So try it out before you go look for much much more expensive alternatives (I don&#8217;t know any DTP program that&#8217;s both affordable and any good). If you should decide to not use BookSmart, be warned that <a title="You can't just send a PDF" href="http://blurb.custhelp.com/cgi-bin/blurb.cfg/php/enduser/std_adp.php?p_faqid=163&p_sid=lGzztU7j&p_url=" target="_blank">you will need to jump a number of hoops</a>.
