If you&#8217;ve been reading my blog for a while, you probably already know that [I like to do everything myself](http://www.streamhead.com/mobility-is-back/ "Repairing a Sony Ericsson mobile phone"). It&#8217;s both for the satisfaction of having done it yourself and to save money. But recently I&#8217;ve discovered that it can be a wise decision to invest in quality services offered by others. For instance, I never thought I&#8217;d buy a WordPress theme but, this weekend, I bought a WooTheme. I got myself the ProBlogger&#8217;s blogger scorecard and am considering a GetSatisfaction membership.

Read on to know what makes these products worth their money (and if you care about that kind of stuff: no affiliate links)

<!--more-->There are a few reasons why you might want to do stuff yourself and not outsource it to other people. Most importantly, because you want to know how it works and it&#8217;s cheaper if you do it yourself. I&#8217;ve always known that there is another side to that coin: doing something you&#8217;re not experienced in takes time, lots of time that you might want to use to do something you are more productive at.

A few examples:

  1. <a title="Copywriting scorecard" href="http://www.problogger.net/archives/2010/08/31/scorecard-price-rise/" target="_blank">The Copywriting Scorecard for Bloggers</a> is something I&#8217;ve been willing to create for a long time. I&#8217;ve collected many links and articles and even tried to start a summary at one time. If you hurry you can still get the scorecard for $9.97 you&#8217;re getting exactly what I wanted to create. Only it&#8217;s here now and you can dive in right away. No need to create summaries, it&#8217;s all there. Even at $29.97 I can wholeheartedly recommend it.
  2. <a title="WooThemes" href="http://woothemes.com/" target="_blank">WooThemes</a> creates and sells premium WordPress themes. I never thought I needed one until I saw the work that went into <a title="Delegate premium WordPress theme" href="http://www.woothemes.com/2010/01/delegate/" target="_blank">Delegate</a> and all their other themes. Not only do you get a detailed and very attractive visual theme for your site, there is also a very detailed back-end to the theme. It allows you to configure virtually any aspect of the theme without the need to write PHP code. For $70 you not only get this theme, but you get to choose 2 more. There&#8217;s no way, you can&#8217;t create this yourself for that price. Not even if you&#8217;re an experienced theme developer.
  3. <a title="Get Satisfaction" href="http://getsatisfaction.com/" target="_blank">Get Satisfaction</a> is a &#8220;social support application&#8221;. It allows you to centralize all support and feature requests in one central place. All your customers have access and can even answer questions of other users. Get Satisfaction greatly simplifies the support process and that is why I&#8217;m considering a starters plan for a new site I&#8217;m working on. Currently I&#8217;m trying out the free plan, but I feel this service is worth every penny.

What services and products are you happy to pay for?
