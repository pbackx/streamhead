As a ramp up of a new project (don&#8217;t worry, I haven&#8217;t forgotten the Android one) which I may or may not start I have been looking for affordable industrial designers or schools in Belgium. There are obviously a <a title="pilipili" href="http://www.pilipili.be/ppsite/index_content.html" target="_blank">bunch</a> of <a title="etoile mechanique" href="http://www.etoilemecanique.com/" target="_blank">consultancy</a> <a title="Enthoven Associates" href="http://www.eadc.be/" target="_blank">firms</a>, but I&#8217;m afraid my budget is too limited.

If you&#8217;re interested in design, there are many sites, but here are a few I really like and I&#8217;m sure you&#8217;ll enjoy too.

  * <a title="Creativeskills.be" href="http://www.creativeskills.be/" target="_blank">Creativeskills.be</a> is specifically aimed at Flemish designers and interested parties. Mind you, it&#8217;s aimed at design in general, so it can be hard to pick out the industrial designers from the others.
  * <a title="Coroflot" href="http://www.coroflot.com/" target="_blank">Coroflot</a> is a nicely designed place to showcase work, to find work and to find designers. The international version of the site above. Also &#8220;recently&#8221; redesigned.
  * If you want information overload, <a title="Dexigner" href="http://www.dexigner.com/" target="_blank">Dexigner</a> is the place to be. uU-to-date news on all disciplines and a database of designers if you&#8217;re looking for some one in particular.
  * There are many blogs out there, showing many objects, but they all seem to rehash each other. <a title="Industrial Design Served" href="http://www.industrialdesignserved.com/" target="_blank">Industrial Design Served</a> has a better choice then most, so it&#8217;s my favorite pick of the bunch.
