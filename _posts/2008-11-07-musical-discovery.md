I used to be a real **electronica** fan. It started with radio shows, but soon enough, I found myself visiting vinyl stores and trying to sample any and all new records. Then the Internet changed things. Suddenly the choice was even more massive than it already was, but it was also much more accessible. Certainly with online stores like Beatport, the ease with which one has access to new music is astonishing.

But times have changed, priorities shifted and it&#8217;s no longer easy to stay up-to-date with new music. I can follow a few choice artists, but mining the depths of new and unknown artists is practically impossible, except for some lucky shots here and there.

There wouldn&#8217;t be a problem that the Internet does not have an answer to. So say hello to **podcasts**. Many professional and amateur DJs around the world now regularly record their mixes and put the on the Internet. A podcast is actually a news feed of music, so the music just automatically apperas on your PC. iTunes is the most known application, but if you are too troubled by Apple&#8217;s guerrilla tactics (trying to install Safari by default), <a title="Juice, the cross-platform podcast receiver" href="http://juicereceiver.sourceforge.net/index.php" target="_blank">there are other solutions</a> (They have such a great logo).

And if you need a lead for a podcast, check out **<a title="This Week at Beatport" href="http://www.thisweekatbeatport.com/site/" target="_blank">This Week at Beatport</a>**. Sadly Pete Smalls seems to not have found the time to update the podcast lately. But <a title="Pete Smalls" href="http://www.petesmalls.com/" target="_blank">his site</a> offers a few newer mixes, so I have confidence that regular transmissions will resume shortly.

What&#8217;s your favorit podcast?
