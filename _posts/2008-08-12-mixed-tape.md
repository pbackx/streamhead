This is part of a Mercedes-Benz advertising campaign, but it&#8217;s interesting and worth a mention none-the-less. At <a title="Mercedes-Benz.tv" href="http://mercedes-benz.tv/" target="_blank">mercedes-benz.tv</a> they host regularly updated TV shows, amongst others &#8220;<a title="Mercedes-Benz.tv Mixed Tape" href="http://www.mixed-tape.com" target="_blank">Mixed Tape</a>&#8220;. The music ranges from the popular (Alanis Morisette) to the obscure. You get a bunch of clips and about 10 tracks that you can download as MP3.

It&#8217;s interesting both for the choice of music itself, but also for the technology. I think this is the type of advertisement I can deal with and I&#8217;d like to see more. You, as a user also get something out of it. It&#8217;s not just trying to convince you how great their cars are.
