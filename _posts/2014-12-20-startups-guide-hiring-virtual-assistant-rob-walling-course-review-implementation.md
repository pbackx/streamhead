One of the major time sinks when starting up a SaaS are the simple things. Following up with people who start a trial. Making sure every one is paying on time and if not, sending them a friendly reminder. Work that is perfectly suited to a virtual assistant (VA). That&#8217;s exactly what I thought when I bought [Rob Walling&#8217;s course on Udemy](https://www.udemy.com/startups-guide-hiring-virtual-assistant-va/) about a year and a half ago.

[color-box]In 2014 I read, viewed and listened to a lot of stuff. To keep a record of what I learned, I&#8217;m going to organize these reviews around an important question asked and/or answered in the book. This is the second part about [the Udemy course &#8220;A Startup’s Guide to Hiring a Virtual Assistant&#8221;](https://www.udemy.com/startups-guide-hiring-virtual-assistant-va/)[/color-box]

A Startup&#8217;s Guide to Hiring a Virtual Assistant by Rob Walling was released in the summer of 2013. It took me until the fall of 2014 before I actually took the time. But at that time, I really was motivated to hire a VA to help me with the menial tasks of [running a SaaS](http://www.fctr.be).

Straight from the start, I hit a roadblock. My web application is in Dutch and is aimed at Flemish people. On a worldwide scale, that&#8217;s a small niche group. One that is not very well served by Rob&#8217;s preferred way of finding VAs: oDesk.

Yes, you can find Dutch speaking VAs there, but the price they were asking was fairly high ($35+/hour). For that price, I wanted a local VA that really knew the local culture.

I was stuck there for quite some time, procrastinating until I started noticing some options to find people:

  * Local classified sites. Unlike eBay, these sites allow to advertise services. In Belgium the major options are [2dehands.be](http://www.2dehands.be/) and [kapaza.be](http://www.kapaza.be/).
  * Classified adds in local newspapers. There are a few adds each week. Not a lot, so you may not want to bother with this.
  * Google. But don&#8217;t search for VAs. The term is not known around here and I can imagine it&#8217;s also pretty unknown in other parts of the world. Search for your local version of &#8220;secretary&#8221; or &#8220;administrative help&#8221;.

Unlike a site such as oDesk or eLance, it&#8217;s more complicated to interview different people and keep an overview.

Due to this added complexity I skipped some of Rob&#8217;s advice and didn&#8217;t compare the candidates thoroughly. That was a mistake that cost me time and money. So in the future, I&#8217;ll be sure to use Rob&#8217;s ready made template.

I started with my VA experiment about a month ago, so it&#8217;s a little too early to judge the results. I can already say that the course has helped me in focusing on the right things.

There&#8217;s one major drawback with the course and that is the price. Compared to some of the other courses on Udemy, it&#8217;s a little short if you pay full price. However, there are very regular promotions, so keep an eye on the Udemy Facebook or Twitter account.
