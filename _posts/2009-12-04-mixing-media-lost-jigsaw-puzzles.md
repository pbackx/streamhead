Those who have followed the blog for some time, probably already know that <a title="alternate reality dreams" href="http://www.streamhead.com/alternate-reality-dreams/" target="_blank">I love alternate reality games</a> and the <a title="virtual treasure hunt" href="http://www.streamhead.com/virtual-treasure-hunt-real-cash-prizes/" target="_blank">mixing of different types of media</a>. Once again, I&#8217;ve been suckered into buying stuff I really don&#8217;t have time for: <a title="Lost jigsaw puzzles" href="http://lostpedia.wikia.com/wiki/Jigsaw_puzzles" target="_blank">the Lost jigsaw puzzles</a>.

I&#8217;m a huge fan of the series, especially <a title="Lost season 5 episode guide" href="http://www.tv.com/lost/show/24313/episode.html?season=5&tag=list_header;paginator;5" target="_blank">the fifth season</a>, so imagine my surprise when I stumbled upon a Lost themed jigsaw puzzle. I picked one of the 4 available puzzles at random and then it took my a long long time before I actually started putting it together.

The more I see of it, the more I&#8217;m sorry I didn&#8217;t buy the others too. The one special thing about this jigsaw is that you don&#8217;t have a picture of the end-result. So you&#8217;re working in the dark. However the designer of the puzzle has put in enough clues that you&#8217;re never really stuck. The colors, for instance, are very well chosen and guide you trough the process, without making it too easy.

I also noticed that there is something on the back of the puzzle. Turns out it is one forth of the hatch map, which you might remember from season 2 if you&#8217;re a fan. You need the other 3 puzzles to complete it. Although I have no idea how I would turn the jigsaw around. Luckily other people have already done this work.

There&#8217;s a lot to discover and a lot that has been put into this simple jigsaw puzzle. It&#8217;s great and if you are interested in Lost or jigsaw puzzles, you might want to pick it up if you find it somewhere.
