During **June 2010**, 2 months from now, Streamhead will be on location, **road-tripping through the Western** part of the **United States**. The plans haven&#8217;t finalized yet, but that&#8217;s where I need some input. Inside the post, I&#8217;ve added a map with some of the locations that we might visit. I&#8217;d love to get some suggestions by insiders, little places that aren&#8217;t in any of the guides. Stuff like that. And most of all, **I&#8217;d love to meet up**.

<!--more-->Before I continue, let me show you our current travel ideas. We will focus on 4 major areas: 

**Las Vegas, Grand Canyon and the parks around it; Yellowstone; Portland, Oregon and San Francisco**. Here are some points of interest (use the little square icon in the top right for full screen goodness):

During the trip me and the misses would love to meet up with anyone who&#8217;s in the neighborhood. Locals and tourists alike, we&#8217;d love to hang out. Have a beer, enjoy the scenery. Talk Java and Flash, but also traveling, social security and surfing. Anything really. For privacy ans security concerns (for both you and me, you never know on the &#8216;net), I&#8217;m only going to share detailed dates and places with people interested in meeting up.

For your enjoyment, here&#8217;s <a title="Interaction Design" href="http://tynerblain.com/blog/2010/03/01/measuring-interaction-design/" target="_blank">a special little form</a>, that you may fill at your leisure if you feel like meeting up.
