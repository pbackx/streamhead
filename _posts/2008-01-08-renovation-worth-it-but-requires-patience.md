Currently, my main project is the renovation of a small house, I bought. The proper euphemism would be: it&#8217;s a challenge. Coordinating all the parties involved, finding the materials, maintaining the budget, and still liking the end-result. Not easy, but it is rewarding.

Many people share their trials and tribulations on the Internet, and it is eye-opening to follow those. Case in point: [&#8220;Jay&#8217;s Barn&#8221;](http://www.verbier-technologies.ch/jason/Site/October%2022%202005.html). A beautiful conversion, and the view &#8230; I want one of those. It&#8217;s been 2 years and still not quite finished, this sort of thing gives me hope and courage, that I&#8217;m still on track to eventually move into my own house. Just like me, Jay did an almost complete rebuild of the house, leaving only some of the walls (sort of) and adapting it to the needs and wants of &#8220;modern&#8221; household. I&#8217;m a sucker for one big living room (kitchen, diner, sofa all in the same place), so he struck a chord.

I don&#8217;t think, I will be [importing my kitchen from Canada](http://www.flickr.com/photos/8028269@N06/sets/72157603143583515/), but who knows what exotic things might happen. It&#8217;s an [adventure](http://www.ifarchive.org/).

update: I don&#8217;t know what to think of [Robert Bruno](http://www.robertbruno.com/). Is he a nut, or just some one with extreme dedication? His steel house has been under construction for 28 years. The result is amazing, yet, I don&#8217;t know if I actually would want to live in it (sounds sort of hollow, if you check out the video). He reminds me of [Gaudi](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Antoni_Gaud%C3%AD), they&#8217;re still working on [his cathedral](http://www.sagradafamilia.org/).
