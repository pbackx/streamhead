Another year has passed, so it&#8217;s time to take a short look back and think about what to do in 2016.

<!--more-->

Previous years: [2014](http://www.streamhead.com/2014-review-2015-preview/),Â [2013](http://www.streamhead.com/2013-review-looking-forward-2014/), [2012](http://www.streamhead.com/year-review-2012-goals-2013/), [2011](http://www.streamhead.com/review-and-preview-2012/), [2010](http://www.streamhead.com/streamhead-in-2011/).

## 2015

The year went by very quickly.Â Out main goals was moving into our new house. Sadly, that was not possible, so it&#8217;s also 2016&#8217;s goal.

On other fronts, my freelancing career continued nicely. I switched clients late 2015 and I&#8217;m now working for a smaller company. A nice change of pace.

In 2015 I started to remove some obligations from my plate to make space for new endeavors. I&#8217;m not sure I succeeded, but it was fun doing all kinds of smaller things:

  * [I read 13 books](https://www.goodreads.com/user_challenges/2516032). The subjects ranged widely, which was a good idea.
  * I winded down my main side project. It&#8217;s still running, but I&#8217;m no longer accepting new signups. I don&#8217;t intend to pursue this anymore ([see my 2014 review for more details](http://www.streamhead.com/2014-review-2015-preview/))
  * At the end of 2014, [a forum I run](http://forum.byopvr.com/) was overrun by spam. [I migrated it to Discourse](http://www.streamhead.com/the-future-of-forums-civilized-discourse/). The migration itself was successful and was an interesting technical feat. The spam is gone, but nobody really cares much about the subject anymore (PVR&#8217;s are dead since Netflix)
  * [I had some fun with static site generators](http://www.streamhead.com/static-site-generator-shootout-jbake-vs-jekyll/).
  * [CloudBees left me with little choice, so I now self-host Jenkins](http://www.streamhead.com/hosting-jenkins-server-pros-cons/).
  * I learned Meteor and applied it to a project. [Discover Meteor](https://www.discovermeteor.com/) is a great book if you want to learn. [It was fun, but the project itself doesn&#8217;t really interest me any more](https://flippa.com/5881067-saas-app-for-people-to-track-their-expenses-dumbed-down-simplified-mint-com).
  * I mined and bought some BitCoins. Not sure what&#8217;s next.
  * I started getting into Scala (I followed [Martin Odersky&#8217;s course on Coursera](https://www.coursera.org/course/progfun) and I&#8217;m currently reading [Pragmatic Scala](http://amzn.to/1RchlTb)). I don&#8217;t really know why Scala won over Groovy, but it seems that&#8217;s the way it is. Both language are perfectly fine, so I&#8217;ll just go with the winner (for now)
  * [I fixed an old DCC player](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WnzOl_aejvw). I wasn&#8217;t sure I could pull this one of. But after a stressful 4 hours, it came back to life and was able to play all my cheesy 90s tapes again ðŸ™‚
  * I started playing Kerbal Space Program

## 2016

I want to continue the same trend as last year. Lots of small things. Some items on my list:

  * Read more books (I&#8217;ve set my goal at 20 this year)
  * [I just finished building a RepRap Prusa i3. I intend to learn how to actually use it properly](http://www.thingiverse.com/pbackx/makes).
  * Going back to the DiscogsScan Android app was great. I have a lot of features I&#8217;d like to add. Including some where I can use Scala ðŸ˜‰
  * [Try to remove additional distracting side projects from my life. I&#8217;m starting by selling one (if any one is interested, otherwise, I&#8217;ll just shut it down)](https://flippa.com/5881067-saas-app-for-people-to-track-their-expenses-dumbed-down-simplified-mint-com)
  * I would like move a few sites (including this one) to Jekyll. Hosting them is so easy compared to WordPress.
  * Also something that has been nagging me to study deeper: Apache Spark and big data in general.
  * Fly my nano quadcopter more (actually a hexacopter) and understand how to tweak and maintain it.
  * I also got a little bit into value investing last year. I may continue that. However I&#8217;m not sure if I can offer much interesting advice.
  * There&#8217;s a lot more on my list, including robotics, papercraft, Zabbix, playing more Kerbal Space program and other games and much more

## Enjoy the new year

Lets see what we can make this year.
