The latest craze in WordPress are theme frameworks. There&#8217;s a reason so many people are talking about and creating them. A theme framework allows you to quickly and easily create a new custom theme, while building on top of a very sturdy foundation. And the addition of <a title="How to make a child theme for WordPress" href="http://op111.net/53" target="_blank">child themes</a> to WordPress has made it possible to upgrade the framework, without having to change anything to the theme that is using that framework.

In order to advance this site, I&#8217;ve been planning a major design upgrade. So be prepared for some changes in the coming weeks. I started with some research into theme frameworks. <a title="Wordpress Theme Frameworks" href="http://www.catswhocode.com/blog/wordpress-theme-frameworks" target="_blank">There are many</a>, but here are three I liked:

<!--more-->

  1. <a title="Hybrid WordPress Theme Framework" href="http://themehybrid.com/themes/hybrid" target="_blank">Hybrid</a> is probably the best documented of all frameworks. There are many pages with clear instructions available. The only downside: if you want to access that info, you have to become member of the &#8220;theme club&#8221; At $25 per year it is very affordable.
  2. <a title="The Buffet Framework" href="http://www.zy.sg/the-buffet-framework/" target="_blank">The Buffet framework</a> caught my attention because its default template is very pretty. It has everything you might wish (including breadcrumbs) right out of the box in a very nicely designed template. The documentation side is a bit lighter though, so you might need some previous framework/child theme experience.
  3. In the end, I picked the <a title="Thematic, A WordPress Theme Framework" href="http://themeshaper.com/thematic/" target="_blank">Thematic</a> theme framework. Its features closely match many of the previous frameworks. What set Thematic apart is its community. There&#8217;s a very lively discussion going on with many people asking and answering questions. Which is always useful.

Whichever of the above frameworks you pick, I&#8217;m sure you&#8217;ll be happy. I would even suggest that your next theme does start from a child theme. Many of things you might not want to worry about are already solved for you (SEO for one thing).

If you are a WordPress blogger, I have a few questions for you: Are you already using a framework? Which one and why?
