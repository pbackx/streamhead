In the spirit of cleaning up some of my older projects, <a title="The Streamhead store" href="http://astore.amazon.co.uk/watje-21" target="_blank">I&#8217;ve completely overhauled my little Amazon store and added an entirely new category</a>. I know this sounds like a commercial message and yes, I will earn a small commission if you order anything, but the store is something I take seriously. I only offer things I&#8217;m absolutely sure you will like if you like this blog.

<a title="The Store Only I Will Like" href="http://www.streamhead.com/the-store-only-i-will-like/" target="_blank">Previously, I explained the philosophy behind the store</a>. It&#8217;s a glimpse into my private office, a look at my bookshelf and at my hard discs. I love to get an idea of the ideas behind people. I hope you&#8217;ll like this look too.

Although it wasn&#8217;t easy, I have gone over all the existing categories in my store and thrown out all the stuff that is no longer available. For instance, I really hated to remove &#8220;<a title="Grim Fandango" href="http://www.mobygames.com/game/grim-fandango" target="_blank">Grim Fandango</a>&#8221; from the list. But I think I&#8217;ve found some very very good alternatives.

Also new is the &#8220;reading list&#8221;. It&#8217;s a mixed bag, but you&#8217;ll certainly find something you&#8217;ll like. I have tried to avoid the purely technical books, because they usually don&#8217;t remain very fresh for long.

<a title="The Streamhead store" href="http://astore.amazon.co.uk/watje-21" target="_blank">Enjoy the shop</a>.
