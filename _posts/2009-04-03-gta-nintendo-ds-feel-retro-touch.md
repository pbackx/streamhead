Quite some years ago, we discovered a little game called **Grand Theft Auto** (I think it was GTA 2). It involved a **top-down view with tiny cars**, lots of violence and large explosions. We used to play the multiplayer game religiously, trying to create the largest explosion.

Then GTA moved into the 3D realm and we all rejoiced. **GTA3 was an incredibly good game**, a landmark. Many times better than any of the previous games. But, those who played the old games, were missing something. It was something intangible. The cartoony feel of the 2D game. The view from the sky with the small cars. It&#8217;s difficult to explain, especially since the latter games were much better.

Imagine my surprise when I saw the screenshots for the **DS** version of GTA, Chinatown Wars. Something deep inside jumped. The screenshots took me back. <a title="GTA Chinatown review on Gamespot" href="http://www.gamespot.com/ds/action/grandtheftautochinatownwars/index.html" target="_blank">Reading the reviews</a> I was even more convinced. It&#8217;s the **combination of oldskool looks with new gameplay**. Brilliant.

I can&#8217;t wait until it arrives in the mail.
