With a long delay, I am now closing the 5 top positions of my online radio station top 10. Others stations are coming, but you only need those five.

The fifth entry, [Zen FM](http://www.kndserver.be/zenfm/), is actually also a &#8220;real&#8221; radio station. Since it only transmits its analogue signal in [Ghent](http://www.visoog.be/index.php?lang=eng), I&#8217;m not sure if that even counts. The station is somehow related to [Topradio](http://www.topradio.be/), but it&#8217;s not very clear how. Maybe it&#8217;s an experiment of them to check out if the formula holds any promise.

And now for a short history lesson. In Ghent, Topradio was once known as S.I.S. I have no idea what the letters stand for, and I can&#8217;t seem to find it on the net. They were the cutting edge of dance music, spreading New Beat when it was new. I was a fan up into the mid-nineties when clubbing suddenly turned big business and I sorta lost track.

But now they are back on my radar with this Zen FM station. I&#8217;m going to excuse the not-too-inspiring name (everything is [zen](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Zen) these days, even [CSS](http://www.csszengarden.com/)), because any station that plays [Chelonis R. Jones](http://www.myspace.com/chelonis)&#8216; &#8220;[I don&#8217;t know](http://www.discogs.com/release/219694)&#8221; is a good station, in my opinion.
