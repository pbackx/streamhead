I have a soft spot for everything <a title="Experience it as if you were there - Virtual Reality revisited" href="http://www.streamhead.com/experience-it-as-if-you-were-there-virtual-reality-revisited/" target="_blank">Virtual Reality</a>. Although it is no longer fashionable to use that name, we&#8217;re seeing a lot of related technology pop up all over the map. More and more movies are shown in 3D. Mostly children&#8217;s animation movies for now, but IMAX too is jumping on the train. And the number of augmented reality expirments out there is uncountable.

I haven&#8217;t posted much about <a title="Spatial Augmented Reality gives a different view on reality" href="http://www.streamhead.com/spatial-augmented-reality/" target="_blank">all this</a>, because most of the technology is still in its infancy and requires a hefty time investment. However, Microsoft has been silently improving a related tool called <a title="Photosynth" href="http://photosynth.net/" target="_blank">Photosynth</a>. While it&#8217;s not Virtual Reality or &#8220;true&#8221; 3D, it could be an important part of a true virtual reality engine.

Photosynth allows you to upload a number of photographs of an object or room. It then goes through this set of images and virtually reconstructs that room or object. You get a nice interface to navigate around. Lets look at this example of all my pictures of the Statue of Liberty I took on my holiday:



It&#8217;s only based on 11 photos, so it&#8217;s not as good as it could have been, but I think the front portion of the statue came out great. Photosynth figures out the overlapping portions in fotos and calculates the angles under which the pictures were taken. It&#8217;s ingenious, and the simplicity of the interface hides a lot of very complicated Math, I&#8217;m sure.

If you want some better examples of what Photosynth is capable of, take a look at <a title="Photosynth Map" href="http://homepage.ntlworld.com/keir.clarke/photosynth.htm" target="_blank">this Google map</a>.

If only we could get access to all that 3 dimensional data, great stuff would happen. So Microsoft, could you please give us an extensive API for this little miracle of software so we don&#8217;t need to <a title="export point clouds from photosynth" href="http://binarymillenium.com/2008/08/exporting-point-clouds-from-photosynth.html" target="_blank">mess with Python scripts</a>?
