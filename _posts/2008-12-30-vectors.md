If you are working with printed media or Flash, one obstacle you will run into on a regular basis is that source material on the Internet tends to be bitmap based, while it is much easier to use <a title="Vector Graphics - Wikipedia" href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Vector_graphics" target="_blank">vector based images</a> for those types of things.

I myself <a title="Vector vs Bitmap side-by-side" href="http://www.streamhead.com/vector-vs-bitmap-side-by-side-svg-png-in-flash/" target="_blank">have written about it</a>, but there&#8217;s <a title="Understanding bitmaps and vectors" href="http://desktoppub.about.com/b/2006/02/26/understanding-bitmaps-and-vectors.htm" target="_blank">a lot of literature</a> on the difference between bitmap and vector graphics. One question that arises: how to convert between the 2 formats? There&#8217;s vector to bitmap conversion, which is relatively easy. Because all lines are defined in the vector drawing independent of the resolution, it&#8217;s just a matter of entering the image size you want and figuring out where you want to put the corresponding pixels. Usually called <a title="Rasterisation - Wikipedia" href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Rasterisation" target="_blank">rasterisation</a>, it&#8217;s an especially interesting problem in a 3D context.

But this post is about the other way around. The conversion from bitmap to vectors. A real artist will do it by hand: put the bitmap image as a background in <a title="Inkscape. Draw Freely." href="http://inkscape.org/" target="_blank">Inkscape</a> and start creating curves that fit. It is a slow process, but it can lead to incredible results. There is an easier way however, right inside Inkscape there is a &#8220;trace bitmap&#8221; option that will do the job for you. Albeit with lower quality, but it will be finished during this lifetime.

<img class="alignnone size-full wp-image-740" title="Trace Bitmap in Inkscape" src="http://www.streamhead.com/wp-content/uploads/2008/12/trace_bitmap.png" alt="Trace Bitmap in Inkscape" width="434" height="171" srcset="http://www.streamhead.com/wp-content/uploads/2008/12/trace_bitmap.png 434w, http://www.streamhead.com/wp-content/uploads/2008/12/trace_bitmap-300x118.png 300w" sizes="(max-width: 434px) 100vw, 434px" />

Just a small sample to get you going:

  * I started with <a title="Portugal on Flickr" href="http://flickr.com/photos/watje/2462164600/" target="_blank">this picture from my Flickr set</a> and first cleaned it up a little. There was on object blocking the camera (a strap? I&#8217;m not sure) and it&#8217;s a bit out of focus. So I cropped it until I got this:

<img class="alignnone size-full wp-image-741" title="squareporto" src="http://www.streamhead.com/wp-content/uploads/2008/12/squareporto.png" alt="squareporto" width="346" height="344" srcset="http://www.streamhead.com/wp-content/uploads/2008/12/squareporto.png 346w, http://www.streamhead.com/wp-content/uploads/2008/12/squareporto-150x150.png 150w, http://www.streamhead.com/wp-content/uploads/2008/12/squareporto-300x298.png 300w" sizes="(max-width: 346px) 100vw, 346px" />

  * I opened the image in Inkscape and traced it. I put it in color mode with 8 passes. This means the resulting image will have 8 colored layers and thus also 8 colors. You might want to increase that a bit for some pictures, but I think it gives a nice stylized result (converted back to PNG so it works in all browsers) :

<img class="alignnone size-full wp-image-745" title="squareportotraced" src="http://www.streamhead.com/wp-content/uploads/2008/12/squareportotraced.png" alt="squareportotraced" width="346" height="344" srcset="http://www.streamhead.com/wp-content/uploads/2008/12/squareportotraced.png 692w, http://www.streamhead.com/wp-content/uploads/2008/12/squareportotraced-150x150.png 150w, http://www.streamhead.com/wp-content/uploads/2008/12/squareportotraced-300x298.png 300w" sizes="(max-width: 346px) 100vw, 346px" />

Now what can you do with that vectorized image? There are a few options:

  * Supersize it or isolate small parts for neat effects

<img class="alignnone size-full wp-image-748" title="large" src="http://www.streamhead.com/wp-content/uploads/2008/12/large.png" alt="large" width="770" height="244" srcset="http://www.streamhead.com/wp-content/uploads/2008/12/large.png 770w, http://www.streamhead.com/wp-content/uploads/2008/12/large-300x95.png 300w" sizes="(max-width: 770px) 100vw, 770px" />

  * Split it in layers
