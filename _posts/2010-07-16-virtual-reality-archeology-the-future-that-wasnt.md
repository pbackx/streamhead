Sometimes you guys surprise me. Again I hear discussion on turning off comments on blogs, but I love your comments. I want to receive more! Especially if they lead me to sites like <a title="VRtifacts" href="http://www.vrtifacts.com/" target="_blank">VRtifacts</a>. A site on everything that Virtual Reality was. All the promises it once held, but that never came to fruition. It&#8217;s the story of yet one more bubble, explained by some one with a lot of artifacts.

<!--more-->A while ago 

<a title="Experience it as if you were there - Virtual Reality revisited" href="http://www.streamhead.com/experience-it-as-if-you-were-there-virtual-reality-revisited/" target="_blank">I wrote about Virtual Reality</a> and asked the question what happened. I even felt like a comeback was due, with all the 3D monitors and motion input devices, I think today this is even more true than it was back then.

Recently <a title="comment on Virtual Reality" href="http://www.streamhead.com/experience-it-as-if-you-were-there-virtual-reality-revisited/#comment-52723613" target="_blank">reader Virtuate mentioned</a> <a title="VRtifacts" href="http://www.vrtifacts.com/" target="_blank">VRtifacts</a> and its treasure tome of VR tidbits. If you&#8217;re into digital history and oldskool nostalgia you owe it to yourself to subscribe to the site.

And Tone (VRtifact&#8217;s creator) even uploads a tutorial from time to time. This will make sure you can relive those fond memories.
