WAMP is a software package that runs in Windows and includes an Apache HTTP Server, the MySQL database and PHP running on the server. If you want the cheapest way to run a website, it is probably the way to go. Although the LAMP version (which runs on Linux) might save you just a few more bucks.

The reason why you might have a use for a WAMP package is if you are running a website. Even if you&#8217;re just testing out a new theme on a WordPress installation, it is safer to first try it out on a test system. Developing on a production system is never the way to go. Even what looks like a minor change, can quickly turn in a website going offline.

There are <a title="Comparison of WAMP packages" href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Comparison_of_WAMPs" target="_blank">many WAMP packages</a> out there. Some are in the most exotic languages, others are commercially supported. <a title="WampServer" href="http://www.wampserver.com/en/" target="_blank">WampServer</a> is one of my favorites. Mostly because it has a nice taskbar icon with easy access to the different services. You can quickly stop and start Apache and MySQL. The different configuration files are at your fingertips. I&#8217;m not sure if any of the other packages has that, but I really like this little productivity boosts.

If you&#8217;re running Windows and need a PHP development environment, a WAMP package really is the way to go. No messing around with FTP connections to server, it&#8217;s all there on your system.
