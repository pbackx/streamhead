While you are reading this, I am enjoying a break on a sunny beach, far away from any electronics (except maybe my DS). To give you a little taste, I&#8217;ve taken a few random shots of Flickr and morphed them together with one of <a title="Deadmau5 free early tracks" href="http://www.streamhead.com/?p=64" target="_blank">Deadmau5&#8242; early tracks</a>.

Morphing is a visual effect to transition between 2 images, the initial goal of the effect was to make the transition seamless but the principals can be used to create interesting distorted visuals. As always, <a title="Wikipedia on Morphing" href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Morphing" target="_blank">Wikipedia had much more detail on this</a>. It&#8217;s an effect that is used more then you&#8217;d think, I even suspect <a title="MotionPortrait" href="http://motionportrait.com/e/" target="_blank">these guys</a> of using it instead of their &#8220;3D face animation&#8221;. But it&#8217;s also an effect that never really grabs attention. There were a few video clips using it, many years ago. So long ago, in fact, I can&#8217;t remember the artist.

I used <a title="WinMorph by DebugMode" href="http://www.debugmode.com/winmorph/" target="_blank">WinMorph</a> and it&#8217;s video editing brother, <a title="Wax, non linear video editing" href="http://www.debugmode.com/wax/" target="_blank">Wax</a> for this video. Make sure to not use the version 1.0 of Wax that is bundled with WinMorph, it is pretty buggy and not compatible with the most recent, much improved, 2.0e version. However, if you don&#8217;t like it, there are many more applications out there, just pick your favorite.
