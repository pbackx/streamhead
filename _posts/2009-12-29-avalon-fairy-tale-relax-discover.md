Avalon is a strategy game, but not unlike any you know. <a title="Avalon Game Download" href="http://www.bigfishgames.com/download-games/5697/avalon/index.html?afcode=afd8c7f28bf3" target="_blank">You may try it out immediately</a> or continue to read my praise. It&#8217;s not a free game, but it will be worth your money.

I have a few more developer related posts ready, full with interesting tidbits and technical knowledge. But before I pressed the publish button, it occurred to me that this is the last week of the year. A year for relaxation and contemplation. So I delayed the posts and here is one that will inspire you to chill out and relax.

As I mentioned before, Avalan is a strategy game in which you manage fairies and their homes. There is some resource gathering. And that is where the comparison to most strategy games ends. It has a a lot of odd twists thrown into it. The minigames are probably the most surprising part. To increase production levels of buildings and improve the performance of your fairies you can play a number of minigames.

But my favorite part is the discovery one. In each environment you have to perform a number of tasks. The fun part is that they aren&#8217;t explained at first. You have to discover them by trying out different things on objects with the fairies. Some are more clear than others.

All of this combined with a leisurely pace and an enchanting world results in a very relaxing game without time pressure. It&#8217;s up to you how you discover the game world.
