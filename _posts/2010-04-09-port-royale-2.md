It&#8217;s been a while since I featured a game, so here is one that has been filling my precious weekend time: <a title="Port Royale 2 - Mobygames" href="http://www.mobygames.com/game/windows/port-royale-2" target="_blank">Port Royale 2</a>. Port Royale 2 falls in a genre that we don&#8217;t often see any more. It&#8217;s a pretty hardcore simulation. So you might be surprised if you&#8217;re usual gaming fair are first person shooters. Don&#8217;t despair, though, <a title="Port Royale 2 on Steam" href="http://store.steampowered.com/app/12470/" target="_blank">you can get the game on Steam for very little</a>.

<!--more-->But lets get back to what makes Port Royale 2 so great. It simulates the wide range of activities in the life of a merchant in the Caribbean during the 16th century. You&#8217;ll encounter and fight pirates, but more importantly, you&#8217;ll trade a number of goods. You&#8217;ll run an entire fleet of cargo and war ships. You build the industry and even run entire towns.

The vast range of possibilities within the game is impressive. It&#8217;s what will keep you coming back for more and more. It&#8217;s also, at first, overwhelming. Which is the hardest part of the game: there is an extremely steep learning curve. Although there are a number of campaigns, each a little harder than the previous, there&#8217;s still a lot to take in.

Personally, the ship-to-ship fighting is my least favorite part. Setting up trading routes and growing towns is what I truly love. Figuring out where to ship what, where to build factories and who to listen to is all part of a grand strategy you&#8217;ll have to develop to win at this game. Accompanied by the orchestral music and the bright graphics, you&#8217;ll feel like the most powerful man in the 16th century world.

If you like games such as Civilization, SimCity or other deep simulations, you own it to yourself to try this one. Once the rich atmosphere of Port Royale 2 gets to you, there&#8217;s no stopping.
