The blogosphere is buzzing with the bad news of the economic downturn. It&#8217;s all going down and certainly your site is. Or isn&#8217;t it?

Via <a title="Twitter / Guy Kawasaki" href="http://twitter.com/guykawasaki/status/1149484039" target="_blank">Guy Kawasaki&#8217;s Tweet</a> I found <a title="Digital Marketplace: Q1 not a 'Nuclear Winter'" href="http://www.mediaweek.com/mw/content_display/news/digital-downloads/broadband/e3ic96aa80f511fb30f1377fb18ac6594b9" target="_blank">this article</a>. It&#8217;s a bit of a **mixed** bag. Most actual publishers that were interviewed reported their **income wasn&#8217;t really affected**. Media watchers however reported a **major drop** in funds going into online advertising. Also Google Adsense, the mother of all online advertising, seems to be <a title="Links: Will the Recession affect your Google Adsense Earnings?" href="http://www.binaryturf.com/links-will-the-recession-affect-your-google-adsense-earnings/" target="_blank">outputting <strong>mixed signals</strong></a>.

Personally, I have seen **no change in CPC** on the networks I use (I have experiments running with, among others, Chitika and Widgetbucks). The CPC hasn&#8217;t changed at all, as has the clickthrough rate (both terribly low ðŸ˜‰ ). But I must admit that my sample size is so small, it might not be statistically significant.

On the AdWords front, I haven&#8217;t really seen any price drop. In fact, most of my campaigns are on hold, because the **keywords** I use **are just too expensive** to justify paying the market price. Maybe another round of optmization and trials might fix this, buy my current plan is to wait a little, as I do expect a drop in prices. When nobody is advertizing, that&#8217;s when to start. However, I have the feeling that&#8217;s still a long way off, if ever.

Above all, I&#8217;d say: **Think positive**, it certainly isn&#8217;t as bad as most newscasts want you to believe. **Keep doing what you&#8217;re doing**. If it&#8217;s working, it&#8217;ll keep working (at least for now). If it isn&#8217;t, there&#8217;s no better time to make a change than now.
