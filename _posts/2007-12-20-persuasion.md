I&#8217;ve always associated [Neuro Linguistic Programming (NLP)](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Neuro-linguistic_programming) with guys trying to get girls in bed. I&#8217;m sure that sort-of gives you an impression of what I&#8217;ve been reading, probably a bad impression. But today, I was surprised to hear it mention in a totally different context, namely People management and Personal development. I always thought it was just a technique to convince people, usually against their better judgement. But it appears to be much broader then that.
  
So [my interest is piqued](http://www.everything2.com/index.pl?node_id=702382). It doesn&#8217;t take much, I know, but now I have another item on my actions list (Getting Things Done, another religion for the 21th century).
