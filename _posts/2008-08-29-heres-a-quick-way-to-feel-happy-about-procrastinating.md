Learned a lot, accomplished nothing

When I was a researcher, there used to be times when I would have that killer idea in my head. It was going to revolutionize the world and change the Internet as we know it. I still have those ideas in my head, however, I never managed to get them onto paper or, more appropriately, computer. The transformation from brain to anything concrete turned out to be impossible. Either the math just didn&#8217;t quite work out as I had envisioned, or what happened a lot: it looked like it was impossible to get the technology to do what I wanted. It probably never is impossible, it&#8217;s just damn hard. When I look at Google, I see an idea that did manage to make it into reality. I always wonder what their original idea was, it can&#8217;t have been &#8220;search the net&#8221;, it must have been something grander.

So there used to be weeks where I&#8217;d try and try to get those bloody computers do my bidding, but it just never turned out do to what I wanted. Those weeks were not wasted however. Because all the knowledge I acquired during that period helped me later on, do realize other ideas. Ideas that actually turned out to be feasible and implementable in a finite amount of time.

Last week was flashback week. I had a vision of creating an architectural playground on the net. A 3D environment that could be explored and experienced by any one, not just some one who took the time to install a 3D tool, to learn its interface and download/find 3D worlds. However I couldn&#8217;t get it to work like I wanted, so I&#8217;m not going to show you anything&#8230; For now.

It all started with <a title="6 Systems To Have Your Own 3D World" href="http://news.hiperia3d.com/2008/07/6-systems-to-have-your-own-3d-world.html" target="_blank">this blogpost</a>. It shows you more than a few ways to integrate 3D right on your homepage. I had a nice idea for a 3D world, so &#8220;why not?&#8221; I thought. And on top of that Google&#8217;s Lively had been in my &#8220;do something with it&#8221; queue for a while. So I started going down the list of suggestions in that post.

I&#8217;ll keep this short, but over a few evenings, I tried both <a title="Google Lively" href="http://www.lively.com/" target="_blank">Lively</a> and <a title="3DXplorer" href="http://www.3dxplorer.com/" target="_blank">3DXplorer</a>. Lively was exactly as the post described. Severely limited, both in performance and in what you can create. Currently there is no way to create your own objects. You&#8217;re stuck with a fairly limited selection of stock stuff. There&#8217;s some promise there, but it will have to mature a bit more.

So quickly I went to choice number 2, 3DXplorer. I was immediately charmed. It works as advertised and <a title="Virtual Benaroya" href="http://3dxplorer.wordpress.com/2008/08/12/virtual-benaroya-%E2%80%93-replicating-famous-places-as-3d-worlds/" target="_blank">the virtual Benaroya concert hall</a> is a great demonstration. But as I started modeling, I quickly became frustrated. The help is limited. For instance, the animation stuff has many links to the API documentation, which I couldn&#8217;t find anywhere. I also was unable to import the Collada 3D files created by the free version of SketchUp. I&#8217;m not sure what went wrong because it did show me the structure in the preview, but I could not load it into the actual environment. I will have to investigate further, in the meantime, really check out <a href="http://www.marketwire.com/press-release/Altadyn-877773.html" target="_blank">that Benaroya hall</a>. It&#8217;s neat to have this right there in your browser. No need to install anything.
