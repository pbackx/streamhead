Many little boys dream of going to space, watching the earth from up there and floating around in zero gravity. Thanks to the Internet, it is now possible to get closer to their dream than ever before. In a case of brilliant marketing, or just plain too much money, NASA is really in the loop when it comes to reaching their target audience.

Not only did Nasa recently <a title="New in Media, Summer 2010: Moonbase Alpha" href="http://www.streamhead.com/new-in-media-summer-2010/" target="_blank">release a moon exploration game</a>, but they are also putting out tons and tons of interesting and detailed materials on all their missions, such as <a title="Take a Personal Tour of the ISS" href="http://www.universetoday.com/24145/take-a-personal-tour-of-the-iss/" target="_blank">this 35 minute tour of the Internation Space Station</a> or <a title="NASA App for iPhone" href="http://www.nasa.gov/centers/ames/iphone/index.html" target="_blank">their iPhone/iPod app</a> that contains an overview of all missions.

Without the Internet there would be no way we&#8217;d get to see footage like this. For some reason the general Belgian public has lost all interest in space exploration, so most television channels never show this kind of footage (not even when there&#8217;s <a title="Frank De Winne" href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Frank_De_Winne" target="_blank">a Belgian</a> up there). Luckily on the Internet even a small audience is a huge audience, so we get those looks and insights into things we&#8217;re probably never going to experience in our lifetimes.

It&#8217;s yet another win for <a title="Wired 12.10: The Long Tail" href="http://www.wired.com/wired/archive/12.10/tail.html" target="_blank">the long tail</a>.

Enjoy the tour.
