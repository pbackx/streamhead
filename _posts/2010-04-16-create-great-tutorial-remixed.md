While some believe <a title="Infographic on Flickr" href="http://www.flickr.com/photos/philgyford/4505748943/" target="_blank">the infographic is dead</a>, I happen to think a graphic representation can help. A good infographic summarizes a lot of information in a condensed and visually  interesting style. It&#8217;s the way I remember stuff.

There are a lot of brilliant articles and blogposts out there that have a lot of great information. They are interesting reads, however I have trouble retaining that info. Yes, I have those articles bookmarked, but they&#8217;re often too long to quickly review.

So I present, <a title="How to Create a Great Tutorial on Anything" href="http://www.streamhead.com/remix/WritingTutorials/" target="_blank">the article remix project</a>.

<!--more-->A  post that has been in my bookmarks for a long time, and one I really should pay closer attention to, is 

<a title="How to Create a Great Tutorial on Anything" href="http://menwithpens.ca/great-tutorial" target="_blank">Harry &#8220;Man With The Pen&#8221;&#8216;s post on how to create a great tutorial</a>. I first wanted to create a PhotoShop image, but it turns out that was going to take way too much time for my attention span. So I ended up taking <a title="960 Grid System" href="http://960.gs/" target="_blank">the 960 grid system</a> for a spin and <a title="How to Create a Great Tutorial - remixed" href="http://www.streamhead.com/remix/WritingTutorials/" target="_blank">this is the result</a>.

It&#8217;s a little rough around the edges, but I really love the concept. I&#8217;m sure I&#8217;ll be doing more of these in the future.

And if you want to print it out for reference, I&#8217;ve also created a PDF version. <a title="PDFonFly.com" href="http://www.pdfonfly.com/" target="_blank">PDFonFly</a> was a great and easy tool for this.
