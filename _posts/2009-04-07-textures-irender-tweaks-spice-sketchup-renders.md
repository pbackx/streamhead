<a title="Using IRender to get a sneak peak at your remodelled home" href="http://www.streamhead.com/method-helping-homeowners-sneak-peak-remodeling-plans/" target="_blank">I can&#8217;t get enough of the <strong>IRender plugin for SketchUp</strong></a>. If that wasn&#8217;t yet clear to you, it&#8217;s about time you became a subscriber to this blog. In this post I&#8217;ll show you a few simple **techniques that can really spice up your SketchUp renders**. The most important technique you&#8217;ll need to really bring those scenes to life it creating, editing and tuning **textures**.

Holding a competition is always a good way to get people moving. So when I heard about <a title="IRender nXt rendering contest" href="http://www.renderplus.com/wk/IRender_nXt_Rendering_Contest_w.htm" target="_blank">IRender&#8217;s contest</a>, I started up SketchUp and got working. Sadly, I never finished my entry, but I did learn a few things that can really help any one in creating nice renders.

Because the idea was to create a photo realistic image, I decided to focus on an existing model and try to get that one as real as possible. My starting point was <a title="Alien Attack by Jon" href="http://sketchup.google.com/3dwarehouse/details?mid=4670f6d640948a74241b9c81f1493015&prevstart=0" target="_blank">this Alien Attack scene by Jon in the Google 3D warehouse</a>. I hear you thinking &#8220;UFOs? Great way to start a realistic render&#8221;. I know, but the idea was to get the scene looking as real as possible.

I opened the scene in SketchUp, searched a good viewpoint, loaded the IRender plugin and this was my first render (click for larger):

[<img class="size-medium wp-image-1178 alignnone" title="first-render" src="http://www.streamhead.com/wp-content/uploads/2009/04/first-render-300x164.jpg" alt="first-render" width="300" height="164" srcset="http://www.streamhead.com/wp-content/uploads/2009/04/first-render-300x164.jpg 300w, http://www.streamhead.com/wp-content/uploads/2009/04/first-render.jpg 800w" sizes="(max-width: 300px) 100vw, 300px" />](http://www.streamhead.com/wp-content/uploads/2009/04/first-render.jpg)

Not bad, not bad at all. If you wanted to go for a cartoony feel, I think you&#8217;d be almost done. For a photorealistic render, there were a few things that are real eyesores. But before I got to that, I wanted to play a little with the lighting. Reducing the natural light and adding a few artificial ones got me this result:

[<img class="alignnone size-medium wp-image-1179" title="first-light" src="http://www.streamhead.com/wp-content/uploads/2009/04/first-light-300x164.jpg" alt="first-light" width="300" height="164" srcset="http://www.streamhead.com/wp-content/uploads/2009/04/first-light-300x164.jpg 300w, http://www.streamhead.com/wp-content/uploads/2009/04/first-light.jpg 800w" sizes="(max-width: 300px) 100vw, 300px" />](http://www.streamhead.com/wp-content/uploads/2009/04/first-light.jpg)

Which was a big step towards the sort-of harsh grainy look I wanted. But one thing stuck out as a major eyesore: the sky. I found <a title="SketchUp skydome tutorial" href="http://www.barnabu.co.uk/sketchup-skydome/" target="_blank">the perfect SkyDome tutorial</a> which got me to this point:

[<img class="alignnone size-medium wp-image-1180" title="first-sky" src="http://www.streamhead.com/wp-content/uploads/2009/04/first-sky-300x164.jpg" alt="first-sky" width="300" height="164" srcset="http://www.streamhead.com/wp-content/uploads/2009/04/first-sky-300x164.jpg 300w, http://www.streamhead.com/wp-content/uploads/2009/04/first-sky.jpg 800w" sizes="(max-width: 300px) 100vw, 300px" />](http://www.streamhead.com/wp-content/uploads/2009/04/first-sky.jpg)

However, at that point, I noticed that IRender has many options for setting the environment. Both the sky and ground can be configured. With a texture change the result was starting to look good:

[<img class="alignnone size-medium wp-image-1181" title="100clouds" src="http://www.streamhead.com/wp-content/uploads/2009/04/100clouds-300x164.jpg" alt="100clouds" width="300" height="164" srcset="http://www.streamhead.com/wp-content/uploads/2009/04/100clouds-300x164.jpg 300w, http://www.streamhead.com/wp-content/uploads/2009/04/100clouds.jpg 800w" sizes="(max-width: 300px) 100vw, 300px" />](http://www.streamhead.com/wp-content/uploads/2009/04/100clouds.jpg)

Not bad, but one thing had been bothering me from the start: those light beams under the UFOs. I searched high and low, but didn&#8217;t really find a good way to do them. It seems to be almost impossible to do good smoke effects. I also wanted a little fog in the background. But it appears to be either impossible, or at the very least extremely difficult.

So in the end I just got rid of the beams entirely. I did add some metallic translucency effects to the saucers. This slowed down the rendering times tremendously, so I never managed to quite get the effect right.

I also noticed that the hay bales were very shiny, which they are not in reality. So I tweaked those, for the final image:

[<img class="alignnone size-medium wp-image-1184" title="perfect-hay" src="http://www.streamhead.com/wp-content/uploads/2009/04/perfect-hay-300x164.jpg" alt="perfect-hay" width="300" height="164" srcset="http://www.streamhead.com/wp-content/uploads/2009/04/perfect-hay-300x164.jpg 300w, http://www.streamhead.com/wp-content/uploads/2009/04/perfect-hay.jpg 800w" sizes="(max-width: 300px) 100vw, 300px" />](http://www.streamhead.com/wp-content/uploads/2009/04/perfect-hay.jpg)

That&#8217;s as far as I got. I might come back to the image. The first thing I plan to do is try out <a title="RpTreeMaker - Render Plus Systems" href="http://www.renderplus.com/wk/RpTreeMaker_w.htm" target="_blank">Render Plus&#8217;s RpTreeMaker</a> to hide the horizon a little. Other things include improving the buildings in the back (maybe add a light, certainly add textures, etc.)

But as you can see, with a few tweaks and no changes at all to the model, you can really change the look of a rendered result. I&#8217;m not showing you all the stuff that look terrible, but one thing is important: experiment!
