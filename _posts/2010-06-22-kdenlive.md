Previously, I mentioned my love for <a title="Camtasia, best-of-breed in screencasting" href="http://www.streamhead.com/camtasia-best-of-breed-in-screencasting/" target="_blank">Camtasia</a>. What attracted me was the extensive video editor that was part of the package. What turned me off was the fairly steep price. Probably just right for professionals, but a little too high for many amateurs. Now, I think I&#8217;ve found the solution in the open source <a title="Kdenlive" href="http://www.kdenlive.org/" target="_blank">Kdenlive</a>.

<!--more-->Kdenlive offers at least the options that Camtasia Studio, and even more. I&#8217;m only missing a quick speech bubbles, but you can reach a similar result, although it&#8217;s a little more involving. The interface is intuitive and similar to many of the best commercial video editing software out there, so you&#8217;ll get used to it really quickly. And if you need that little more, there are about 20 video tutorials available, many more articles and a user forum.

If that very short introduction enticed you to go try out Kdenlive, don&#8217;t be disappointed by the fact that it&#8217;s a Linux program. If you have a Mac, there&#8217;s a MacPort available. If you have any system that runs VirtualBox, there are images. And best of all, there is also <a title="Kdenlive live DVD" href="http://www.kdenlive.org/user-manual/downloading-and-installing-kdenlive/live-demonstration-dvd-or-usb-storage" target="_blank">a live DVD</a> available that you can burn and boot.

There really is no excuse not to try it out.

A big thank you to <a title="Nixie Pixel" href="http://www.nixiepixel.com/" target="_blank">NixiePixel</a> for <a title="Start Editing Videos for Free" href="http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2ohKkEK280w&feature=channel" target="_blank">introducing me to Kdenlive</a>!
