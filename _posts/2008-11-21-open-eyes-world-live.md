The recent financial crisis has demonstrated that we live in a connected world. Many visible, but even more invisible connections between people, companies, countries and their money.

In <a title="Zeitgeist - The Movie" href="http://www.zeitgeistmovie.com/" target="_blank">Zeitgeist</a>, the connections go even further. Do these connections truly exist or not? I have no idea, but I can assure you that these two two-hour long movies will get you thinking. A worthy investment of your time.
