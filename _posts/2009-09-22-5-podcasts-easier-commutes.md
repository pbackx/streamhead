These days, I find myself stuck in traffic a whole lot more than I used to. I have found that an easy way to relieve the stress this induces, is to listen to podcasts. There are many out there, but here&#8217;s a short list of my favorites:

  * <a title="This week in tech" href="http://www.twit.tv/twit" target="_blank">This Week in Tech</a> is the granddaddy of tech podcasts. Its a weekly show that features a bit of all the tech news. It&#8217;s like reading Gizmodo or Engadget, only you do it in the car.
  * The <a title="Personal Finance Hour" href="http://personalfinancehour.com/" target="_blank">Personal Finance Hour</a> discusses all things personal finance. It&#8217;s not as news driven as many podcasts, so there&#8217;s more depth. The topics discussed are pretty broad (financial consequences of pets, loans, &#8230;) so I tend to skip an episode now-and-then, but overall this is a very informative radio show, even for non-Americans.
  * The <a title="Harvard Business Ideacast" href="http://www.google.be/url?sa=t&source=web&ct=res&cd=1&url=http%3A%2F%2Fhbsp.libsyn.com%2Frss&ei=E2-4SsjzN4ft-Abx3_i6BQ&usg=AFQjCNFX-YjFHEdhPoTxQLr3FOF5XnGLGA&sig2=X-unqC7-Qr0U4yyN2OYimQ" target="_blank">Harvard Business Ideacast</a> are usually short (10 to 15 minutes) interviews with leading business experts. The range of people interviewed is broad, but always business focused. And the interviews aren&#8217;t too long, so people without MBAs (me) don&#8217;t get bored.
  * <a title="Rebel FM" href="http://www.eat-sleep-game.com/news/category/rebel-fm-podcast/" target="_blank">Rebel FM</a> is my favorite games related radio show.
  * The podcast for <a title="A State of Trance" href="http://www.astateoftrance.com/" target="_blank">A State of Trance</a> is only a shortened version of the actual show,Â  so you might want to download the show instead of the podcast. It depends on how much trance you can handle.

Feel free to leave your favorite podcasts in the comments.
