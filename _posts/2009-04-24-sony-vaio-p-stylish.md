At one point in time, my idea for this blog was to give a summary of the most expensive gadgets out there that allowed you to experience media in the most extravagant way. The <a title="Revox multiroom system, the consumers dream" href="http://www.streamhead.com/the-consumers-dream/" target="_blank">Revox multiroom system</a> is still part of my dreams and I&#8217;m sure it will give any owner a totally different look at his media (any place, any time). I had forgotten about this idea until the <a title="Sony Vaio P at Gizmodo" href="http://i.gizmodo.com/5125930/sony-vaio-p-super-dont+call+it+a+netbook-hands-on" target="_blank">Sony Vaio P</a> came along and stole my heart.

The news has been out for a while and the P has been on sale for some time, but sadly, <a title="Sony Vaoi P at Expansys" href="http://www.expansys.be/p.aspx?i=179824" target="_blank">prices haven&#8217;t dropped yet</a>. I&#8217;m on the lookout for a nice and portable way to surf the net over wi-fi and the P would be perfect. Yet I&#8217;m afraid I&#8217;ll be stuck in &#8220;affordable town&#8221; with an iPod Touch. Which is apparently also a great device, so I&#8217;m not sure I&#8217;ll mind too much.

What&#8217;s your favorite ultraportable device?
