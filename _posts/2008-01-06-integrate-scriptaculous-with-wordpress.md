I don&#8217;t know if you noticed, but if you click the little &#8220;nav&#8221; link on the left, the navigation menu disappears. If you click it again, it will reappear. This is done via a little JavaScript and the script.aculo.us library.

I have written [a short tutorial on how to achieve this effect](http://www.streamhead.com/technology/index.html). It is intended for the real novice. Let me know if you like it and/or if you have any issues or suggestions.
