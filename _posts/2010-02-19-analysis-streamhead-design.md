If you&#8217;re visiting the site, you will undoubtedly have noticed the new design. If you&#8217;re following the site via the feed or e-mail, now is a very good time to click through and check out the new incarnation of Streamhead. In this post, I go over what went in to creating the new design and what is still to come.

<!--more-->The new design consists of surprisingly little coding and images, thanks to some great work by other people and a little by me:

  * <a title="Three WordPress Theme Frameworks" href="http://www.streamhead.com/thematic-wordpress-theme-framework/" target="_blank">The Thematic <strong>theme framework</strong></a> is an incredible useful and solid foundation to build on. Creating a child theme is child&#8217;s play and you immediately get all the good stuff of Thematic. Adapting it&#8217;s CSS is even easier. Messing with the functions was a little harder, but I didn&#8217;t need to change a lot.
  * If you have a reasonably new browser, you will also notice the **custom font**. I tried to give my blog something unique by adding a different font. I will be evaluating this choice in about a month. In the mean time, I really love the <a title="Oregon LDO font by Luke Owens" href="http://www.fontspace.com/luke-owens/oregon-ldo" target="_blank">Oregon LDO font by Luke Owens</a>. Together with <a title="free @front-face generator" href="http://www.fontsquirrel.com/fontface/generator" target="_blank">the @font-face generator</a>, adding the font to the page was a breeze.
  * I haven&#8217;t mentioned <a title="Textures and SketchUp" href="http://www.streamhead.com/textures-irender-tweaks-spice-sketchup-renders/" target="_blank">SketchUp</a> in a while, but I used it to create **the header image**. I tried and liked <a title="Kerkythea" href="http://www.kerkythea.net/joomla/" target="_blank">Kerkythea</a> to render the image. And a little <a title="Paint.NET - Free Software for Digital Photo Editing" href="http://www.getpaint.net/" target="_blank">Paint.NET</a> for the finishing touches. All of those are high quality free tools that almost any one should have on their PC.

Mix all of that with a little CSS and out came the new design. I like it a lot more than the previous, but we&#8217;ll see if it stays for just as long.

As always, nothing is ever really finished, so there&#8217;s a pretty large to-do list:

  * For some reason, the colors of the header don&#8217;t match in Internet Explorer (they look fine in Firefox and Chrome)
  * I will be adding a few more widgets in the sidebar. I&#8217;m not sure if it was popular, but I liked the random posts.
  * The posts now use the WordPress build-in thumbnail and &#8220;more&#8221; features, which means I have to go over all posts and introduce those. I&#8217;m not particularly looking forward to this task, but it will make the frontpage and category pages a lot nicer.
  * I don&#8217;t like the front page, I will be adding some &#8220;themed&#8221; areas and pages with a few selected posts, which will make it easier for people to navigate the backlog of the blog.
  * and probably a ton more that will popup while I&#8217;m working on the others.

So stay tuned, this blog is evolving. And let me know what you think of the new look, I&#8217;m really interested in your opinion.
