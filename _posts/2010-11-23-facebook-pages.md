It has finally happened. <a title="Streamhead Facebook Page" href="http://www.facebook.com/pages/Streamheadcom/125286610865885" target="_blank">Streamhead now has a Facebook page</a>. The idea has been growing on me for a few months now, but yesterday I reached some kind of threshold and just got on with it. Very fashionably late.

Why now you wonder? And how did it work out? Well, I&#8217;m glad you asked.

<!--more-->Although I just saw 

<a title="The Social Network - IMDB" href="http://www.imdb.com/title/tt1285016/" target="_blank">The Social Network</a>, that was fairly unrelated to my decision. Attending Devoxx and watching a bunch of my friends, I noticed how many people carry Facebook with them. It&#8217;s their source of news and where they spend their time. It&#8217;s a good place for a site to be if you want to be discovered instead of searched for.

I tried publishing the Streamhead posts to my own personal page, but there was a huge mismatch between the content I usually like to share there and my blogs content. So after a few posts, I turned this off.

This is exactly why I created a page. It allows me to **aggregate all Streamhead&#8217;s posts and related news** without disturbing my friends who are probably not interested in the latest Java features.

Creating <a title="Streamhead Facebook Page" href="http://www.facebook.com/pages/Streamheadcom/125286610865885" target="_blank">the Streamhead page</a> itself was a little more complicated than I expected. First of all, I was **unable to find a &#8220;create page&#8221; button**. I&#8217;m not sure if it exists somewhere, but eventually I found a link in the help center.

**The help center was a very useful resource**. It&#8217;s pretty well-organized and contains answers to most questions you might have. It was a pity that some answers were outdated. For instance, I was unable to import my blog via the Notes application. Maybe I missed something, but the instructions seemed to deal with a previous version of the Facebook interface.

Setting up the page itself was a breeze. Although I really have no idea why Facebook is so scared of lists. The only way to go back to your page is via the search box. I don&#8217;t understand why I can&#8217;t just get a list of pages I administer.

Other nice things I&#8217;m experimenting with:

  * The Facebook widget is now on the right side of the blog. Although it looks pretty good, I personally think it&#8217;s way too large, but I&#8217;m going to wait and see for a bit how people interact with it.
  * I&#8217;m still experimenting with the Mailchimp application. I couldn&#8217;t have done it without their tutorial because it isn&#8217;t very straightforward. Next, I still need to change the signup form to something more sexy. But it&#8217;s a start.

I will be tweaking the page, so <a title="Streamhead Facebook Page" href="http://www.facebook.com/pages/Streamheadcom/125286610865885" target="_blank">click on that &#8220;like&#8221; button now</a> to keep up-to-date. I will also actively maintain the page and post something extra from time to time, so I can get a good idea if a Facebook page is worth the effort.
