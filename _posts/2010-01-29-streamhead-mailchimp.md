I&#8217;ve recently switched to <a title="MailChimp" href="http://eepurl.com/g1j9" target="_blank">MailChimp</a> for email delivery of the new posts. MailChimp describes itself as an email marketing tool. What sets <a title="MailChimp" href="http://eepurl.com/g1j9" target="_blank">MailChimp</a> apart from similar tools, is the many many options for configuring campaigns, email lists and reports. All of this in a very user-friendly interface. Instead of FeedBurner&#8217;s very sparse mails, subscribers to Streamhead will now receive a nicely laid out, weekly email, summarizing all the activity on the site.

Email marketing has gotten a pretty bad name because of all the spam and I am terribly bored by all the courses, promising you millions, if only you&#8217;d get an email list. I was hesitant for a long time, but I was also terribly frustrated with the limited email options in Feedburner. So I took the plunge. I am very happy I did, not only is MailChimp a very user friendly way for configuring email campaigns and lists, but they also have great tutorials and regular, live screencasts to get you started.

So if you feel like checking out the blog via your email reader, subscribe now via the box on top of the page. In the future I might send an exclusive post to the list from time to time.
