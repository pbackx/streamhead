If you&#8217;re anything like me, you probably have at least one PC and one laptop on your desk, maybe even more. And all of those have a separate keyboard and mouse. It&#8217;s not a pretty sight for a minimalist. Luckily, there&#8217;s <a title="Synergy" href="http://synergy2.sourceforge.net/" target="_blank"><strong>Synergy</strong></a>, a program that allows you to share one keyboard and mouse across several computers, no matter what operating system.

With Synergy installed, you run the server version on the PC of which you want to use the keyboard and mouse. On all the other computer, you run the client version that connects to the server.

It might take some time to get the setup just right, but that is a one-time occurrence. One thing I really appreciated was the shared copy-and-paste buffer. Copy on one computer and paste on another.

Synergy is s so seamless that you might soon try to move windows to different screens, but because you&#8217;re still dealing with different computers, that is not possible.

Try <a title="Synergy" href="http://synergy2.sourceforge.net/" target="_blank">Synergy</a> and get rid of those extra keyboards and mice.
