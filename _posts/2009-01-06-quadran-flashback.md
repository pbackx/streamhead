I don&#8217;t think I&#8217;ve ever mentioned Quadran or Philippe Van Mullem on the Streamhead blog. Which is a real shame. So for my second post of the new year, I&#8217;m going to invite you to collect as much of his music as possible.

The Internet has made it basic, to get an overview of the man&#8217;s career. Just take a look at the Discography pages for <a title="Quadran Discography at Discogs" href="http://www.discogs.com/artist/Quadran" target="_blank">Quadran</a> and <a title="Phillippe Van Mullem Discography at Discogs" href="http://www.discogs.com/artist/Philippe+Van+Mullem" target="_blank">Philippe Van Mullem</a> and you already have a good overview of the depth of the back catalog. The discographies don&#8217;t seem to be complete though, they are certainly missing a few Internet only releases, like <a title="Quadran tracks not listed on discogs" href="http://www.audiojelly.com/tracks/91692" target="_blank">this one</a> (the Fanfaria track is the most obvious giveaway that this is really the same artist). He started his producing career somewhere in the early 1990s under the Honey C moniker.

There&#8217;s a lot of his music on [AudioJelly](http://audiojelly.com/ "AudioJelly online mp3 shop") and also [Beatport](https://www.beatport.com/ "Beatport") offers a bunch, so give yourself a little present to start the year. It will last you for a long time.

As a very special bonus, here&#8217;s the complete booklet for Quadran&#8217;s Voyages CD:
