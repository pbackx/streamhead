As you read this post, I will be on my first stop of a 3 week long roadtrip through New England (North East of the USA) and Canada. Usually, I don&#8217;t plan too much, but I do like to know my options before boarding the plane. The Lonely Planet and Rough Guides are my preferred paper helpers. But this year, I&#8217;ve really found the Internet to be an valuable resource.

Here&#8217;s a list of sites I couldn&#8217;t have done without:

  1. <a title="Yahoo! trip planner" href="http://travel.yahoo.com/trip" target="_blank">Yahoo! Trip Planner</a>: There are a few trip planners on the web, but Yahoo!&#8217;s is the most complete. It has an incredible amount of hotels, attractions, destinations and comments available. It tends to be a bit slow from time-to-time and the interface can be a bit confusing, but once you&#8217;re used to it, it&#8217;s pretty ok.
  2. <a title="Virtual Tourist" href="http://www.virtualtourist.com/" target="_blank">VirtualTourist.com</a> is one of the largest user community sites entirely dedicated to tourist tips. The best hotels, the worst tourist traps, you&#8217;ll find them all on Virtual Tourist. Together with the Yahoo! Trip Planner, and a few guides, Virtual Tourists gave me all information to plot out a route. Most of the other sites, I&#8217;ve used to find affordable hotels and transportation.
  3. To fill in the blanks, I&#8217;ve used <a title="Google, find everything" href="http://www.google.com" target="_blank">Google</a> a lot. I know this sounds like a stupid suggestion, but through Google I&#8217;ve found a few great sites. Such as the <a title="VisitPA" href="http://www.visitpa.com/index.aspx" target="_blank">VisitPA</a> one. I really love it, and because of that one, we&#8217;ll be staying a few days in Pennsylvania.
  4. <a title="ebookers" href="http://www.ebookers.com/global.html" target="_blank">ebookers</a> is a European travel site, so I&#8217;m sorry to all my American readers. But I&#8217;m mentioning this site first, because it seemed to have the best rates.
  5. <a title="Hotels.com" href="http://hotels.com/" target="_blank">Hotels.com</a> is a similar, but a worldwide site. I think it offers the widest range of options and I plan to use this on the road to book last-minute hotel rooms for cheap.
  6. <a title="Booking.com" href="http://www.booking.com/" target="_blank">Booking.com</a> rounds off the trio of hotel search sites. Although they do have overlapping offers, they also all seem to differ just a little. But 10% price difference can really impact your budget (more money for drinks and amusement parks)
  7. If you want cheap plan tickets, <a title="Supersaver" href="http://www.supersaver.nl/" target="_blank">Supersaver</a> is the place to be. No other site could even come close to the prices they have.
  8. Well, ok, if you&#8217;re not in the countries supported by Supersaver, the very popular <a title="Expedia" href="http://www.expedia.com/default.asp" target="_blank">Expedia</a> does have many good flight offers.
  9. <a title="TripAdvisor" href="http://www.tripadvisor.com/" target="_blank">TripAdvisor</a> is more of a allround site. It does offer flight and hotel search, but there&#8217;s much more. You can search for things to do and read many many reviews. It&#8217;s nice if you find a hotel or venue on one of the sites above and want a second opinion.
 10. If you can&#8217;t find an affordable hotel, you can always turn to <a title="Hostels.com" href="http://www.hostels.com/" target="_blank">hostels.com</a>. Hotels in major cities tend to be extremely expensive, so if you can do without the luxury, a hostel is a nice second choice.

In spite of all this planning, We&#8217;re also leaving a lot open for exploration and we&#8217;ll fill in the gaps as we see fit. But it&#8217;s always nice to know the options.

What do you think, are any important sites missing?
