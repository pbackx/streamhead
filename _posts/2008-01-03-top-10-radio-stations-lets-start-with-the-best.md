One of my many hobbies is music. I try to listen to as wide a range of music as possible, but my heart has always been beating for an underground electronic music genre, called progressive house or trance.

An ideal way to find new music is online radio stations. I used to have a long list of stations, but lately I have stuck with one: [friskyRadio](http://www.friskyradio.com/) (their capitalization). It&#8217;s fresh, as we used to say. At least, I don&#8217;t think that expression is very popular any more.

It&#8217;s one very dependable source of quality music. Any time of the day, any place, any mood. Go ahead and turn them on. The genre ranges from electronic to progressive to trance and on. Usually, their shows are usually pretty relaxed. Don&#8217;t expect high energy pumping 2 o&#8217;clock packed-dancefloor beats, think more of the afterhours. The obvious advantage is really that they are listenable even while working and, most of the times, won&#8217;t even bother any one around that isn&#8217;t into &#8220;this kind&#8221; of music.

But I could go on and on. Just have a listen and decide for yourself.

I will be adding a few other favorites over the next few weeks. I might reach 10, I&#8217;m not sure yet.
