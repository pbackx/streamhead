I&#8217;ve <a title="The New Streamhead Design" href="http://www.streamhead.com/analysis-streamhead-design/" target="_blank">dabbled a bit in custom fonts for websites</a> (using the @font-face CSS property), but this gave me mixed results. So I dug a little deeper on how to get things right. Turns out, it&#8217;s not that easy and requires a little knowledge of a lot of things. Here are 5 resources that will help you get started.

## <!--more-->1. Fonts

[<img class="size-full wp-image-2238 alignnone" title="Creative Nerds" src="http://www.streamhead.com/wp-content/uploads/2010/04/creative_nerds.png" alt="" width="504" height="213" srcset="http://www.streamhead.com/wp-content/uploads/2010/04/creative_nerds.png 504w, http://www.streamhead.com/wp-content/uploads/2010/04/creative_nerds-300x126.png 300w" sizes="(max-width: 504px) 100vw, 504px" />](http://creativenerds.co.uk/)

There are numerous (<a title="Xkcs : Literally" href="http://xkcd.com/725/" target="_blank">literally</a> thousands) of summing up some of the best new (and free) fonts out there. Here&#8217;s <a title="40 Beautiful Free Fonts" href="http://creativenerds.co.uk/freebies/40-beautiful-free-fonts-for-creating-attractive-typography-headlines/" target="_blank">a nice example</a> to get you started.

## 2. @font-face Generator

[<img class="alignnone size-full wp-image-2241" title="font-face-generator" src="http://www.streamhead.com/wp-content/uploads/2010/04/font-face-generator.png" alt="" width="486" height="142" srcset="http://www.streamhead.com/wp-content/uploads/2010/04/font-face-generator.png 486w, http://www.streamhead.com/wp-content/uploads/2010/04/font-face-generator-300x87.png 300w" sizes="(max-width: 486px) 100vw, 486px" />](http://www.fontsquirrel.com/fontface/generator)

With your font in hand, the trick is to make it work with as many browsers as possible. There are many proprietary CSS properties and even more undocumented &#8220;features&#8221;. Luckily, font Squirrel&#8217;s <a title="@font-face generator" href="http://www.fontsquirrel.com/fontface/generator" target="_blank">Font-Face Generator</a> does all the hard work for you. Upload your font and you get a pack in return containing a demo that will work in most modern browsers (and even a few old ones).

There&#8217;s one huge caveat though, if you&#8217;re font doesn&#8217;t include all the right rendering hints, <a title="don't expect too much of the font-face generator" href="http://www.fontsquirrel.com/blog/2009/11/what-to-expect-from-our-font-face-generator" target="_blank">you might end up with pixelated looking fonts</a>. This is especially annoying for thin and small fonts. Of course, many fonts don&#8217;t include the hints, especially the free fonts seem to be lacking them (furthermore, this is almost never properly indicated on download pages)

## 3. Scaling It Down

[<img class="alignnone size-full wp-image-2243" title="24_ways" src="http://www.streamhead.com/wp-content/uploads/2010/04/24_ways.png" alt="" width="598" height="218" srcset="http://www.streamhead.com/wp-content/uploads/2010/04/24_ways.png 598w, http://www.streamhead.com/wp-content/uploads/2010/04/24_ways-300x109.png 300w" sizes="(max-width: 598px) 100vw, 598px" />](http://24ways.org/2009/spruce-it-up)

So if you still love your font, but it looks like a mess for full length articles, why not use it for headers or other small highlights? <a title="Spruce It Up" href="http://24ways.org/2009/spruce-it-up" target="_blank">This technique on 24 ways</a> shows how you can spice up a simple text by replacing only one character.

## 4. Using Default and Existing Fonts

[<img class="alignnone size-full wp-image-2244" title="code_style_font_stacks" src="http://www.streamhead.com/wp-content/uploads/2010/04/code_style_font_stacks.png" alt="" width="521" height="203" srcset="http://www.streamhead.com/wp-content/uploads/2010/04/code_style_font_stacks.png 521w, http://www.streamhead.com/wp-content/uploads/2010/04/code_style_font_stacks-300x116.png 300w" sizes="(max-width: 521px) 100vw, 521px" />](http://www.codestyle.org/css/font-family/BuildBetterCSSFontStacks.shtml)

When all else fails, CSS has a powerful mechanism to specify how and which fonts to use to render pages. You can create a font stack that will try to use existing fonts on the user&#8217;s computer, but in your preferred order. <a title="Better CSS Font Stacks" href="http://www.codestyle.org/css/font-family/BuildBetterCSSFontStacks.shtml" target="_blank">Code Style offers an in-depth look at pre-build stacks</a> that will give you optimal results across browsers and different computer types.

## 5. Typography

[<img class="alignnone size-full wp-image-2245" title="i_love_typography" src="http://www.streamhead.com/wp-content/uploads/2010/04/i_love_typography.png" alt="" width="597" height="93" srcset="http://www.streamhead.com/wp-content/uploads/2010/04/i_love_typography.png 597w, http://www.streamhead.com/wp-content/uploads/2010/04/i_love_typography-300x46.png 300w" sizes="(max-width: 597px) 100vw, 597px" />](http://ilovetypography.com/2008/02/28/a-guide-to-web-typography/)

Not only should you be selecting fonts, you should also use them in the correct setting. <a title="A Guide to Web Typography" href="http://ilovetypography.com/2008/02/28/a-guide-to-web-typography/" target="_blank">I Love Typography has a short and clear introduction to typography</a>. With tips I&#8217;ll be incorporating in the blog design soon.
