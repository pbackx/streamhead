It&#8217;s a great thing what fans can do. Take for instance <a title="OverClockedReMix - Video Game Muisc Community" href="http://www.ocremix.org/" target="_blank">OverClocked ReMix</a>, a community site where every one can upload their remixed game soundtrack. At first, the site will look a bit unstructured, but everything has its place. If you&#8217;re a first time visitor, I would suggest you head straight to <a title="Torrents - OverClocked ReMix" href="http://www.ocremix.org/torrents/" target="_blank">the torrents section</a> and start listening.

Some time ago, I downloaded <a title="torrent ocremix 1 - 1000" href="http://bt.ocremix.org/torrents/OverClocked_ReMix_OCR00001_to_OCR01000.torrent" target="_blank">the first 1000 track</a> (they are already upto 1700!). This is a 3.12 GB collection, over 2 days of music, so if you&#8217;re a bit hesitant, you might want to try out one of the albums. But the collection won&#8217;t dissapoint. It has everything from chiptune remixes to full orchestral &#8220;re-envisionings&#8221;. It&#8217;s great to hear remixed The 7th Guest music. The Age of Empires music was also spot on. But there are so many things on there, if you like video games, you will find something that brings back fond memories.

Ok, one more, <a title="OutRun on Wikipedia" href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Out_Run" target="_blank">Out Run</a>. If you&#8217;ve ever played that game in arcades or at home, the mixes will instantly give you an energy boost.
