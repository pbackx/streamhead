In my continuing effort to bring you the obvious, I would like to point out another medium that has been keeping me busy on the go. Books. You might have forgotten about them, but they sure can be good entertainment, or they can be a source of great wisdom (or both, if you&#8217;re lucky).

I have already talk about NLP, which is on my reading list right now. And I will certainly tell you more about it later. Personal development is sort of a hobby of mine.

But books don&#8217;t always have to teach, they can tell a story. Even have humor. The last thing I haven&#8217;t seen too much, but maybe I haven&#8217;t searched hard enough, maybe I have no sense of humor or maybe I am just to conditioned to accept the &#8220;Friends-like&#8221; one-liner jokes that we are used to seeing on TV and in cartoons. Right now, however, I have found true humor. Even with some science fiction added to the mix, another favorit of mine.

I am currently reading The Hitchhikers Guide to the Galaxy series. And truly enjoying them. The trilogy contains 5 books, each of which are small enough to carry anywhere (buy the paperbacks), and you can open them for a few minutes here and there. I know this isn&#8217;t really an hidden gem or anything, but if it&#8217;s good, it&#8217;s good. Even if it was written a long time ago, even if the author has passed away. This is something that cannot be said of many of todays more popular entertainment. Will you still be watching Friends in a decade or two? Not the best example I know. Black Adder might still be around at that time, but many won&#8217;t.

So there you have it. Go to your local library, and read it a book. It&#8217;s free you know.
