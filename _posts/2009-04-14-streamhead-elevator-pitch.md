As part of the <a title="Write an elevator Pitch for Your Blog" href="http://www.problogger.net/archives/2009/04/06/write-an-elevator-pitch-for-your-blog-day-1-31dbbb/" target="_blank">31 days to build a better blog challenge</a>, I have been thinking about this blogs elevator pitch. What is it all about and how to communicate it to random people. I believe that this is a very important step in focusing a blog. I&#8217;ve been doing it from time to time, usually behind the screens. But here is my current elevator pitch:

_&#8220;**Streamhead** is a the quick-start resource for professionals wanting to **keep up with the changing media and the technology** on which it is built. From **tutorials** of the latest web trends, to **analysis** of new ways to reach your audience. While Streamhead also publishes news, it is **not just any news site**, it searches for the **connections and common themes** in the latest events, so you can focus on deciding if and how you can incorporate this in your projects. Streamhead tries to avoid the empty marketspeak and only shows you useful technology, **and how to apply it right now**, not somewhere in the far future. We know that it can be difficult to keep innovation in your products, so that is why **Streamhead&#8217;s summary and hand-ons will make sure you won&#8217;t miss a thing**.&#8221;_

It might miss a little in the &#8220;stand out&#8221; department, but overall it gives a good impression of what this blog is about. I even tried to come up with a new **tagline**: &#8220;**Streamhead, practical media technology coverage for the busy professional**&#8220;. I&#8217;m not entirely happy with it, but I think it too comes close.

I&#8217;ve also been thinking about taglines and pitches that stand out more, but I&#8217;m not too much into hype and hyperbole. So stuff like &#8220;Streamhead, web 3.0, it&#8217;s here and you&#8217;re missing the boat&#8221; is not that appealing to me, although it might work better.

Although this is probably one of the shortest Tuesday posts in a while, it does involve a lot of thinking. If you too are blogging, running a business or creating a product, an elevator pitch is a great tool to focus the mind and focus your project.

BTW I like to just jot down in Notepad whatever is on my mind, but other people might enjoy a more structured tool like <a title="FreeMind - free mind mapping software" href="http://freemind.sourceforge.net/wiki/index.php/Main_Page" target="_blank">FreeMind</a>.
