Every one who regularly runs or works out to music has probably thought about this. Wouldn&#8217;t it be cool to have the music change according to your training tempo? Well, <a title="Synchstep" href="http://synchstep.com/" target="_blank">Synchstep</a> makes it possible. If you have an iPhone/iPod. It&#8217;s fairly cheap, it works with all your music and it works as advertized.

<!--more-->Synchstep uses the motion sensor inside your iPod to calculate the moves you make per minute. This is averaged and used as a base BPM to find music that matches. This, I feel, is the most brittle part of the entire application. The default setting is to change the music after 10 seconds if your BPM changes. Either my tempo isn&#8217;t steady enough or the beat detection is a little too sensitive, but this didn&#8217;t work for me.

I changed this setting to only re-synchronize the BPM after the entire song is played. It isn&#8217;t exactly what I would like, but at least it didn&#8217;t drive me nuts by constantly changing the song.

Apart from this, I really like Synchstep. Although it&#8217;s clear this is still a fairly experimental application it is already very useful.

It starts by indexing the playlists you like. Synchstep gets its BPM data from the net and if it doesn&#8217;t find it, you can download a desktop application to calculate the BPM. And if you&#8217;re still not happy, you can override the automatic detection and enter the correct BPM.

The interface is minimal but very functional. A start button to start measuring and playing music and a BPM scale so you can override the tempo. It would be nice if this was immediately accessible. Right now it first needs to detect your beat. But I felt it could be nice to just enter the BPM and match your run to the music instead of the other way around.

Is Synchstep worth $4.99. It depends. If you expect a fully fleshed out product that never crashes, no, you&#8217;re not going to get what you want. But really, what do you expect for $4.99 anyway? Synchstep is an experimental, yet usable and very promising application. So yes, I would go for it if you&#8217;re interested in using your music library in a different way.
