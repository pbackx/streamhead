Via the <a href="http://mirrors.creativecommons.org/newsletter/ccnewsletter6.pdf" target="_blank">Creative Commons newsletter</a>, I found this bit a free goodness. <a href="http://www.tonetone.org/" target="_blank">Tone</a>&#8216;s &#8220;Small Arm Sea&#8221; album. It&#8217;s a bit short, but very sweet. Forget all about the legal <span><span>mumbo</span></span> jumbo on dual licensing. It just means that you can <a href="http://urlyd.com/section/downloads/tone-small-arm-sea/" target="_blank">download it legally for free</a> and if you feel like it, you can still buy the CD or DVD.

<span>Side note</span>: Watching that video above, I first thought it used <a href="http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=R0RrSm7skrs" target="_blank">morphing</a>, a technique that was popular a few years ago, but <span>sort-of</span> disappeared once the novelty wore off.
