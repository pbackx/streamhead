If your a WordPress admin, how do you test your new or updated theme? If you&#8217;re anything like me, you have a local WordPress installation to test the big changes and do the small things live on the blog (although you know you really shouldn&#8217;t). Well, there is a better solution and it&#8217;s called <a title="Wordpress Theme Tester" href="http://ocaoimh.ie/theme-tester/" target="_blank">Theme Tester</a>.

Written by Donncha O Caoimh, the creator of WP Super Cache, the Theme Tester plugin allows you to freeze the theme configuration to outside visitors but not to yourself. It&#8217;s a great way to mess with things you otherwise can&#8217;t touch on a live system.

Btw: I drafted this post using <a title="Wordpress for iPhone" href="http://iphone.wordpress.org/" target="_blank">the free WordPress application for iPhone</a> and iPod Touch. It&#8217;s missing a few important features to write a complete post (linking, images), but it&#8217;s great for drafting on the go.
