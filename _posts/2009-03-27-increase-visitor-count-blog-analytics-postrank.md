Any news site or blog needs at least some readers. If not, it wouldn&#8217;t be very interesting for the author. To improve your blog and increase your reader count, there&#8217;s one golden rule: **Know your visitors**. Know what makes them tick, what they like to read, to what they react. This post describes a few ways to obtain this knowledge, focusing on PostRank, a great tool for this kind of research.

Most people already have **Google Analytics**, or a similar visitors analytics package installed. And if you haven&#8217;t, you really should. It&#8217;s an easy way to get a lot of knowledge about the origin of your visitors, the number, their behavior.

But **visitor number isn&#8217;t everything**. In fact, I believe they are a bit overrated. I think a much more important metric is **what your users do with the blog post** or news item they read. Do they react to it? Do they share it with their friends? Do they bookmark it for later reference?

It&#8217;s not easy to obtain this kind of information, but <a title="PostRank" href="http://www.postrank.com/" target="_blank"><strong>PostRank</strong></a> does a pretty good job at it. It takes a number of parameters (like number of comments and number of saves on del.icio.us) and calculates a &#8220;PostRank&#8221; for your posts. As with all metrics, it&#8217;s not perfect, but I think it gives a good idea.

Here are my current top 10 posts:


  


It&#8217;s as easy as going to the <a title="PostRank" href="http://www.postrank.com/" target="_blank">PostRank</a> site and typing in your site.

Question to the readers: How do you analyse which post works and which doesn&#8217;t? Do you use another service that you like?
