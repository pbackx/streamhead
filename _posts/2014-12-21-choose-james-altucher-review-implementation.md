[Choose Yourself by James Altucher](http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B00CO8D3G4/ref=as_li_tl?ie=UTF8&camp=1789&creative=390957&creativeASIN=B00CO8D3G4&linkCode=as2&tag=streamhead-20&linkId=A5QJVJ6M4SXN57BL) is mostly a collection of rewritten blog posts. In his typical style James&#8217; explains why you may want to ignore most traditional career and business advice and go your own route.

[color-box]In 2014 I read, viewed and listened to a lot of stuff. To keep a record of what I learned, I&#8217;m going to organize these reviews around an important question asked and/or answered in the book. This is the third post discussing [Choose Yourself](http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B00CO8D3G4/ref=as_li_tl?ie=UTF8&camp=1789&creative=390957&creativeASIN=B00CO8D3G4&linkCode=as2&tag=streamhead-20&linkId=A5QJVJ6M4SXN57BL)[/color-box]

The book organizes and cleans up a number of [James Altucher&#8217;s existing blog posts](http://www.jamesaltucher.com/). If you&#8217;ve been following his blog for some time, you&#8217;ll recognize at least half of the chapters.

The major idea that stuck with me, is that you should organize your live around generating ideas. Writing them down and sometimes act on them.

You can share those ideas, implement them yourself or combine them with other ideas. Eventually success will find you.

Three tips to get more ideas:

  * Work on them. don&#8217;t just expect that ideas will come naturally (some will). Sit down and say to yourself &#8220;I&#8217;m going to write down 10 ideas right now&#8221;.
  * Read a lot.
  * Get more sleep than you think you need.

For one buck, this is a great, slightly disorganized, book that will definitely get you thinking and is bound to spark at least a few new ideas.
