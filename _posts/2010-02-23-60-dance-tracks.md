About 10 days ago, <a title="De Morgen" href="http://www.demorgen.be/" target="_blank">De Morgen</a>, a Belgian (Dutch) newspaper, published <a title="De 60 beste dancetracks van de afgelopen 10 jaar" href="http://www.demorgen.be/dm/nl/1007/Muziek/article/detail/1066383/2010/02/11/De-60-beste-dancetracks.dhtml" target="_blank">the 60 best dance tracks of the last 10 years</a>. 6 DJs and radio celebrities take their pick of what was good in the last 10 years. Unlike what you might expect, the lists where not littered with fluffy pop stuff. Most of it is quality material. Pleasantly surprised, I think this was a great idea. The only problem is that it&#8217;s quite difficult to listen to the lists as they are all embedded as separate tracks. So I&#8217;ve put them in a few YouTube playlists, which make them a lot more manageable .

6 DJs entered their choice, and here they are:

If you clicked through (come on, you know you want to try it), you will have noticed that they open in a nice JavaScript popup. Originally, I wanted to create the code to make that happen myself. <a title="jQuery plugins" href="http://plugins.jquery.com/" target="_blank">jQuery with a few plugins</a> make it possible to quickly create something like this. However, it turns out some one already did the work: <a title="pb-embedFlash" href="http://wordpress.org/extend/plugins/pb-embedflash/" target="_blank">the pb-embedFlash plugin for WordPress</a> is the perfect solution if you want to embed Flash, but also other media types. With tons of options, this is really a one-stop-shop, which I hope will see continued development.

<p class="update">
  <strong>warning</strong> Since pb-embedFlash hasn&#8217;t been maintained for almost 4 years. I have removed the plugin from my installation. This also means the shadowbox no longer works. If you have a good replacement, please let me know.

BTW Surprisingly enough, if you buy <a title="The Trentemoller Chronicles" href="http://www.streamhead.com/2007-the-music-part-1-of-x/" target="_blank">the Trentemoller chronicles</a>, you&#8217;d already have a bunch of those tracks. It looks like there are more people that like him.
