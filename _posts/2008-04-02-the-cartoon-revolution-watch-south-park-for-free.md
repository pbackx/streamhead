In a throwback to the Creative Commons and free stuff in general (see <a href="http://www.streamhead.com/?p=58" target="_blank">previous post</a>), the makers of South Park recently announced all episodes will be freely available on <a href="http://www.southparkstudios.com/" target="_blank">their website</a>.

<a title="Samurai Jack" rel="attachment wp-att-71" href="http://www.streamhead.com/the-cartoon-revolution-watch-south-park-for-free/samurai-jack/"><img src="http://www.streamhead.com/wp-content/uploads/2008/04/samuraijack.thumbnail.jpg" alt="Samurai Jack" align="right" /></a>No longer do you have to resort to <a href="http://thepiratebay.org/" target="_blank">the dark side of the Internet</a> to get your daily fix of cartoons. I&#8217;d like to see more of this. [Samurai Jack](http://www.cartoonnetwork.com/tv_shows/samuraijack/) holds a special place in my heart ever since he fought those possessed rave kids. Now lets also add the Simpsons, Futurama and some others to that list, and you won&#8217;t see me exiting the house for quite some time. So maybe better not.

I wonder if they will ever add a &#8220;real&#8221; full screen option. Maybe when the adds are in place. Because, at some point, somewhere, some one is going to have to be paid. Writers aren&#8217;t doing their job for free, animators need to eat too, etc. And how are small-time cartoonists supposed to profit from this &#8220;everything free&#8221; scheme. More advertising? If South Park Studios has any smarts (and it looks like it), they already have a subscription service ready. A monthly fee for add-free enjoyment.

We&#8217;ll have to wait and see. At least, right now, I can watch every South Park episode for free. So excuse me, I&#8217;ve got to go.
