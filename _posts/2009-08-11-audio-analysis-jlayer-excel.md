<a title="5 Free Audio Analysis Tools" href="http://www.streamhead.com/free-audio-analysis-tools/" target="_blank">As mentioned last week</a>, my next project revolves around audio analysis. The first step is acquiring data and for that,Â  <a title="JLayer, Java MP3 decoder" href="http://www.streamhead.com/jlayer-java-mp3-decoder/" target="_blank">I had already found the perfect Java solution</a>. JLayer makes it easy to obtain data, but a sound file contains very large amounts of it. This post goes into a basic architecture to tame that data and get it into a form that can be processed.

<a title="BeatIt 0.0 NetBeans project" href="http://www.streamhead.com/wp-content/uploads/2009/08/BeatIt_v0.0.zip" target="_blank"><img class="alignleft size-full wp-image-498" title="download" src="http://www.streamhead.com/wp-content/uploads/2008/11/download.png" alt="download" width="30" height="24" />Download the NetBeans example project</a>

There are a few ways to get the wave data out of an mp3 file using JLayer. <a title="MP3 SPI documentation" href="http://www.javazoom.net/mp3spi/documents.html" target="_blank">You could use the MP3SPI driver to play data through the JavaSound API and capture the bytes</a>. But there&#8217;s no reason to make it that complicated.

JLayer can stream data to its own AudioDevice class. This is a callback class that has hooks for opening and closing a device, which we don&#8217;t need. The important hook is the one that sends the bytes to the device. This is where you can capture the raw stream. Most audio analysis, however, doesn&#8217;t use the raw stream, but averages the data to reduce the amount of data to process.

So that is how I ended up with my layered architecture:

  1. JLayer itself decodes the mp3 file and offers the byte stream to &#8230;
  2. &#8230; the audio device. This layer does only very basic processing. In the current example project you&#8217;ll find a device that averages the samples. I could add Fast Fourier Transform in the future.
  3. The final layer are the actual brains. I&#8217;ve called them &#8220;processor&#8221;. This is where the magic will happen.

That&#8217;s all there is to the current version of my project. For now it&#8217;s just a zip file, but if there is interest, I might put it on some public VCS.

The main advantage of the current architecture are:

  * There&#8217;s only one dependency to outside projects: JLayer. This has advantages for portability.
  * Splitting the basic processing that every analysis project needs anyway into its own layer, frees the actual processing from doing actual processing.
