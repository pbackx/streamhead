A happy new year to all of you. Here&#8217;s to another interesting year filled with **exciting challenges**. In spite of all the **economic, environmental and political issues in 2008**, I think it was a thrilling year. I hope, and it seems pretty likely, that **2009 will be the year of change**. The people need it and earth might need it even more.

Personally, I have much more humble goals and resolutions. My most important goal for the first quarter is **finishing <a title="Housing" href="http://www.streamhead.com/housing/" target="_blank">my home renovation</a>**. It&#8217;s about time, so this takes precedence over all other goals. But don&#8217;t fear, I have a lot of good intentions for the blog and my sites. I haven&#8217;t really made them very concrete (<a title="SMART (project management) - Wikipedia" href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/SMART_(project_management)" target="_blank">SMART</a>) yet, because I will have to think about them for a little longer. I might make some <a title="David Seah - Groundhog Day Resolution" href="http://davidseah.com/blog/comments/groundhog-day-resolutions" target="_blank">Groundhog Day resolutions</a>.

Here&#8217;s what I currently have in mind for my sites:

  * The basic idea for next year is that I&#8217;d really make my sites **self-sustaining**. I plan to find a way to pay at least my hosting bills. And if possible, I would like to upgrade to a better hosting account. My <a title="Lunarpages - cheap and reliable web hosting" href="http://www.lunarpages.com/id/pbackx" target="_blank">Lunarpages basic hosting plan</a> has served me well, but I could do with something speedier. I certainly won&#8217;t be adding more advertising. Right now, this is the maximum, but I might move some things around, I don&#8217;t know yet.
  * One thing I have planned is to clean the site up and make it more **accessible**. A blog is great for content that goes out of style in a few days, but I have a lot of interesting things in the archives that deserve a little more exposure. <a title="Joel on Software's new design" href="http://www.joelonsoftware.com/items/2008/12/18.html" target="_blank">It&#8217;s something that other bloggers are also struggling with</a>. As a first step, I&#8217;ve already categorized every post in one of 7 categories.
  * It might proof impossible, but I&#8217;d like to get a little more into **social networks**. I like **StumbleUpon** a lot (<a title="Peter on StumbleUpon" href="http://pbackx.stumbleupon.com/" target="_blank">feel free to send me a friend request</a>) so I&#8217;ll probably start using this a little more intensive. IÂ  also like Plurk, but it appears most people have picked **<a title="Twitter / pbackx" href="http://twitter.com/pbackx" target="_blank">Twitter</a>**, so I&#8217;ll probably get myself <a title="TweetDeck" href="http://www.tweetdeck.com/beta/" target="_blank">TweetDeck</a> and start tweeting away. The time this required might come out of a reduced Google reader subscription count. I&#8217;m still figuring out how to go about that.
  * I would like to add a **3rd post** every week. Maybe something with video or a podcast. I might move the techie tutorials to a **videocast** and change the focus of my long posts a bit to more newsworthy, general things that appeal to a larger audience. Don&#8217;t worry, I don&#8217;t intend to write solely linkbait and listposts from now on. But before I can get started with video I still need to set up a usable production environment. My two previous videos took too much time post-producing.
  * And finally, I may or may not make my hobby sites a bit more professional. Until now, I have treated them as tech demos, but it appears there might be interest from enough people to expand them a bit and give them a more professional appearance.

Not related to this site: but I plan to sort through a tremendous amount of old media (floppy disks, tapes, CD&#8217;s even cassettes) I have lying around in a corner. You might see some stuff popping up now and then.

And because you&#8217;ve read this far, <a title="Viking Defense" href="http://www.miniclip.com/games/viking-defense/en/" target="_blank">here&#8217;s a little gift that will keep you busy for a long time</a>.
