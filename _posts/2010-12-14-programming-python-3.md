&#8220;The joy of coding Python should be in seeing short, concise, readable classes that express a lot of action in a small amount of clear code &#8212; not in reams of trivial code that bores the reader to death.&#8221; &#8211; <a title="Guido van Rossum" href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Guido_van_Rossum" target="_blank">Guido Van Rossum</a>

Last summer, I read the second edition of &#8220;Programming in Python 3&#8221; and wrote <a title="Programming in Python 3, second edition" href="http://books.dzone.com/reviews/programming-python-3-second" target="_blank">a book review for DZone</a>. Unbeknownst to me, the review has been on the Book Zone for a while, so I thought it about time to mention it. Sadly I haven&#8217;t been able to program as much Python as I would have liked, but when I do, I still use the book and still stand behind my initial review.

<!--more-->Python as a language has always intrigued me. It is one of the few languages where white space is actually important. It&#8217;s a bold choice, not without merit and certainly not without its opponents. And that fact alone got my attention.

So when DZone&#8217;s Book Zone offered me a chance to review the book, I rose to the occasion. And really enjoyed it. I&#8217;m not going to republish my review, <a title="Programming in Python 3, second edition" href="http://books.dzone.com/reviews/programming-python-3-second" target="_blank">you should go and check it out</a>.

Suffice to say it&#8217;s a great book to start with Python if you&#8217;re already fairly experienced in pretty much any other language.

6 months later, I&#8217;m ashamed to admit, I haven&#8217;t really grown out of the &#8220;<a title="Parsing Bank Statements in Python" href="http://www.streamhead.com/parsing-bank-statements-in-python/" target="_blank">toy project</a>&#8221; category yet. There are many reasons, but most importantly, it does take some real effort to get to know a new language. I plan to push myself a little more in this regard. Of course, you&#8217;ll be able to follow along on the blog.
