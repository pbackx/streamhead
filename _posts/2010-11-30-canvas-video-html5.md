You can learn the HTML5 canvas and video tag today and prepare for the future of the web. The entire web is abuzz with HTML5 news and tutorials, there has never been a better time to learn HTML5. In this post, I present a first of many resources to get started.

<!--more-->Both the canvas and video element are two of the major new elements in HTML5. If you plan on creating a new website in the coming years, you will certainly come across those two. Although there might still be some controversy on the details (like which video codec to use), both elements are standardized and well supported on the major browsers. Unlike some other HTML5 elements, you can start using them today.

Enter <a title="video + canvas = magic" href="http://html5doctor.com/video-canvas-magic/" target="_blank">HTML5 Doctor&#8217;s video and canvas element tutorial</a>. Not only will you learn how easy these elements are to get into. You&#8217;ll also see what kind of great effects are possible. Not every website will need to manipulate the video images in real time, but it is good to know the possibilities well and have them in your toolbox.

If you&#8217;ve followed my recent posts, you&#8217;ll know <a title="State of the web, getting started" href="http://www.streamhead.com/state-of-the-web-getting-started/" target="_blank">I&#8217;ve been getting into HTML5 web applications</a>. Part of that will be <a title="JavaScript mastery" href="http://www.streamhead.com/javascript-mastery/" target="_blank">JavaScript</a>, but going through the tutorial, it&#8217;s clear that the HTML5 elements will also play a major role. Using the different elements properties, it&#8217;s possible to do some incredibly powerful things with fairly simple JavaScript code.

Which is why I think <a title="video + canvas = magic" href="http://html5doctor.com/video-canvas-magic/" target="_blank">this canvas and video tutorial</a> is a great first step.
