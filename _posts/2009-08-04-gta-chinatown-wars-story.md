Since I have completed the storyline, this might be my final entry on GTA Chinatown Wars. The game only shows me a 48% completion, so I still got a lot of stuff to do. I don&#8217;t think I&#8217;ll be going for 100, but I might take on a few additional missions. According to the in-game counter, I&#8217;ve put over 10 hours in the game, so I got my money&#8217;s worth. However, there are still things I&#8217;d like to discuss.

<img class="size-medium wp-image-1469 alignright" title="gta_cw_main_character" src="http://www.streamhead.com/wp-content/uploads/2009/08/gta_cw_main_character-296x300.jpg" alt="gta_cw_main_character" width="296" height="300" srcset="http://www.streamhead.com/wp-content/uploads/2009/08/gta_cw_main_character-296x300.jpg 296w, http://www.streamhead.com/wp-content/uploads/2009/08/gta_cw_main_character.jpg 376w" sizes="(max-width: 296px) 100vw, 296px" />I haven&#8217;t talked about the story yet, because I didn&#8217;t think it was worth mentioning. It starts of pretty so-so, but in the end things come together nicely and I guess it&#8217;s an acceptable excuse to have a big blowout fight. For a game it&#8217;s pretty ok story. It might even make a movie worth watching, but it wouldn&#8217;t work as a book. As far as storytelling is concerned, game makers are stuck between a rock and a hard place. On one side, you don&#8217;t want to spend too much time in cutscenes to show off your story, on the other hand, it&#8217;s difficult to tell a story if you only have action sequences. Ever since adventure games and full motion video games went out of style, we only have games like Half-life left who walk this fine line pretty nicely

<img class="alignleft size-medium wp-image-1471" title="gta_cw_gunfight" src="http://www.streamhead.com/wp-content/uploads/2009/08/gta_cw_gunfight-296x300.jpg" alt="gta_cw_gunfight" width="296" height="300" srcset="http://www.streamhead.com/wp-content/uploads/2009/08/gta_cw_gunfight-296x300.jpg 296w, http://www.streamhead.com/wp-content/uploads/2009/08/gta_cw_gunfight.jpg 376w" sizes="(max-width: 296px) 100vw, 296px" />If you complete the story missions, you will undoubtely for ever remember the last three missions. The game ends in some seriously intensive gunfights. If you don&#8217;t like the gunplay in Chinatown Wars at all, I&#8217;m affraid you will be a bit bummed by the end. But by the time you make it this far into the game, you&#8217;ll probably have a pretty good grip of how to handle the situation. I thoroughly enjoyed the final missions. Althouh I had to replay them quite a few times. The key to victory: take it slow, don&#8217;t rush.

After you complete the story, the &#8220;Guardian Lions&#8221; mission is unlocked. Once completed, you can upload the mission data to the Rockstar Social Club for a bonus. Although it&#8217;s a small thing, I really love this online integration (and it cuts back on piracy, so it&#8217;s a win-win)

Anyway, if you still haven&#8217;t got the game, and aren&#8217;t convinced by now, I don&#8217;t think I will ever do so, but still: go buy and play the game!
