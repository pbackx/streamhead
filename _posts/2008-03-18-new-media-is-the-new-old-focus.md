Inspired by [David Seah&#8217;s article on refocusing his website](http://davidseah.com/blog/comments/friendship-focused-marketing-take-1/). I also started thinking. In many regards, I&#8217;m also continuously adapting my site(s). But stripped from all fills, what is the goal of this blog? Of this website? As is, I&#8217;m sure, it is impossible for a random visitor to figure it out. That&#8217;s probably because I&#8217;m not even sure myself. This weblog evolved from [a music-only blog at Radio](http://radio.weblogs.com/0118796/) to [a selfhosted mp3 blog](http://www.streamhead.com/watje/), to what you are reading right now, a more general blog.

A few years ago, I bought the domain for one reason only: To market a neat little stream ripping tool I had written in my spare time. A tool that was &#8220;good enough&#8221; for me, but which will probably never make it to anything near &#8220;production quality&#8221;. I had that realization at the end of last year, which is when I decided to just put a blog in place and write about anything that crossed my mind.

There was also a side-thought of monetizing the blog, but I&#8217;m not sure about this. Is it worth it? And more importantly, do I want to &#8220;delude&#8221; the blog with advertising? Is adding adds deluding the blog? I&#8217;m kind of happy with the Amazon referral links at the end of posts so they will probably stay. But I&#8217;m not sure about putting banners or advertising links everywhere. And when your not convinced, you tend to manifest the exact opposite outcome (see [&#8220;law of attraction&#8221;](http://www.stevepavlina.com/blog/2006/08/the-law-of-attraction/), although [I&#8217;m not entirely convinced of that either](http://www.scotthyoung.com/blog/2007/05/31/be-yourself-law-of-attraction-and-other-pieces-of-bad-advice/)). So I&#8217;ll leave it at that for now. I might search some blog networks, those look &#8220;more friendly&#8221;.

But first I need focus. I have looked through my posts and my mind, and apart from some exceptions, I&#8217;m very fond of [&#8220;new media&#8221;](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/New_media) or old media on new media. I don&#8217;t like buzzwords, so I just tend to reuse old ones. I do love the new 3D stuff that
  
is happening ([remember this?](http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=I0DmbMqx2DM)). Demos are back. I already did mention them a few times, but you&#8217;ll hear more about them for sure.

For instance, I love [the Alfa Romeo site](http://www.alfaromeo.com/) (check out the models section), it&#8217;s a large download, but it&#8217;s great that we have arrived at a point in time where such a site is feasible. Creating this stuff is even accessible to any enthusiast. Check out [processing](http://vimeo.com/658158) or [the papervision3D engine](http://www.papervision3d.org/). All free, all cool.

I might even bring back the original streamhead shuffle app. It&#8217;s still a cool idea, just not a very user friendly tool. Who knows?
