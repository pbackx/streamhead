Back in 1996, this was how I got to know the French. Mind you, as most Flemish teens, I did know about France and had already visited Paris and been to some random touristic areas. But talking to and meeting actual French guys of about my age, no, that was new.

So imagine our surprise when we booted up this mix of [kid program](http://fr.wikipedia.org/wiki/Chapi_Chapo) and inside jokes. A demo that wasn&#8217;t really innovative in any way, but it was fun! Many jokes are lost in time, few people will probably get the introduction reference to Second Reality, although in 1996 _every one_ got it. It&#8217;s silly.

You can [download the original executable from pouet.net](http://pouet.net/prod.php?which=300), but you probably won&#8217;t be able to run this &#8220;as is&#8221;. It requires many memory tweaks (remember [xms, ems & co](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Extended_Memory_Specification)? Seriously, you don&#8217;t want to) and most important of all, it required the technological marvel that was the [Gravis Ultrasound](http://www.gravisultrasound.net/). Imagine, a _red_ expansion card (back then, nobody made boards in red), the size of your computer. It used to be the best sound card, the only real competition were the cards by Creative Labs, a company you might now know as Creative.

If you want to run this demo, get [DOSBox](http://www.dosbox.com/) and it will run like a charm. You probably have to be an oldskool demoscener to really appreciate the brilliance of DOSBox. Demos that you thought were lost in time, because you don&#8217;t have the hardware any longer, are now just a few clicks away. It&#8217;s not perfect, but it is close enough.
