[![Time is relative](http://www.streamhead.com/wp-content/uploads/2008/02/planetravel.thumbnail.jpg)](http://www.streamhead.com/wp-content/uploads/2008/02/planetravel.jpg "Time is relative")

Take the plane. Fly a few times around the world. Get out. Enjoy the future.

Cool isn&#8217;t it. You will only have travelled a few nanoseconds into the future, but hey, time-travellers can&#8217;t be choosers. Magnify this setup, and you are really on your way. [Richard Branson is working on something](http://www.virgingalactic.com/) that might get you there.

But how do you get back? That&#8217;s where [Paul Davies](http://cosmos.asu.edu/)&#8216; &#8220;How to Build a Time Machine&#8221; comes in. You only need a collider, an imploder, an inflator and a differentiator. The details are in the book. Of course, it&#8217;s not that easy, and there will be some challenges on the way. Like some courses in [quantum mechanics](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Quantum_mechanics), and access to [some serious hardware](http://public.web.cern.ch/Public/Welcome.html). But the story is excellent entertainment if you are the least bit interested in the material.

I think I&#8217;ll get started on [that fusion reactor](http://www.iter.org/) to supply me with the necessary power.
