The end of the year is not only a time to look back, but also forward. Read on for what&#8217;s in store for Streamhead. It&#8217;s going to be a great year, so make sure you don&#8217;t miss a post. If you become <a title="Streamhead Facebook Page" href="http://www.facebook.com/pages/Streamheadcom/125286610865885" target="_blank">a Facebook fan</a>, you not only get the latest posts, but also a bunch of supremely interesting links. Or if you prefer to receive the posts by mail, use the field just below this post. And of course, there&#8217;s always <a title="Streamhead feed" href="http://www.streamhead.com/feed/" target="_blank">the feed</a> to bend Streamhead to your every wish.

But enough about that, let&#8217;s get to the plans.

<!--more-->In general, I&#8217;m pretty happy with the more technical direction Streamhead took. I plan to continue in the same direction, and would like to revisit a few older posts in this new light. So you can expect 

**more code samples, more experiments and more tutorials**, combined with the latest and most interesting news and articles.

## HTML5, CSS3 and co

Oh yes, you can expect lots more web 2.0 posts (or are we at v3 already?). JavaScript will definitely return into the picture and probably a good deal of ActionScript. As always I&#8217;ll be on the lookout for new maturing technology both on client and server.

I personally really liked my latest post on <a title="Building the Io language on Windows" href="http://www.streamhead.com/io-language-on-windows/" target="_blank">the Io language</a> in this regard. I hope to write more like those.

## Mobile

There&#8217;s no escaping. Mobile devices are here and they are here to stay. While I have done some very small experiments with Android and mobile websites, next year is the year I&#8217;m really investing time in applications for the small screen. And you&#8217;ll be in the front row seat.

## Online Marketing

Don&#8217;t worry, this blog isn&#8217;t going to turn into a get-rich-quick scheme. With the launch and ongoing development of <a title="launching my first vaadin appengine project - FCTR.be" href="http://www.streamhead.com/launching-my-first-vaadin-appengine-project/" target="_blank">my own web application</a>, I did notice I&#8217;m missing some important knowledge. I&#8217;m thinking of Search Engine Optimization (SEO), traffic analysis, conversion tracking, etc. for normal people.

## Game Modding

You might have noticed by my frequent posts on gaming, I love to play a game from time to time. Back in the days I enjoyed adapting the game and its mechanics. Known as <a title="Mod (computer gaming) on Wikipedia" href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Mod_%28computer_gaming%29" target="_blank">modding</a>. It&#8217;s a great way to learn a wide range of different disciplines. 3D, artificial intelligence, new languages, etc. So I&#8217;d like to get back into that. We&#8217;ll see how that goes.

Have a great 2011!
