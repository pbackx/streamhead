Last Sunday&#8217;s <a title="GRAMMY.com" href="http://www.grammy.com/" target="_blank">Grammy</a>&#8216;s certainly have awarded some of the most popular artists. Coldplay, Daft Punk, Madonna and many others are certainly not bad artists, but don&#8217;t they get enough exposure anyway? What about all the little artists out there?

## The long tail

There&#8217;s this theory out there, that the Internet will enable even the most unknown musician (or artist or &#8220;thing&#8221;, in general) to thrive. Because the economy of scale, even the smalles niche of the smallest niche, will get the exposure it deserves. This is called <a title="The Long Tail - Wikipedia" href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/The_Long_Tail" target="_blank">the long tail</a>.

In contrast, to the big record companies, who put all their money in just a few artists, chosen because they will appeal to the most common denominator, the theory of the long tail claims that it will be just as economically viable to put a little money in hundreds of artists.

In fact, **on the Internet the cost of distributing an artist&#8217;s music is close to zero**, which would mean, that conceivably, you can offer any song by any artist up for digital download.

<a title="The Long Tail, discussed" href="http://www.longtail.com/the_long_tail/2008/06/excellent-hbr-p.html" target="_blank">That&#8217;s the theory</a> &#8230;

## The long question

The elephant in the room is this one big question: there&#8217;s this huge long tail, millions of great songs. It&#8217;s out there. But **how do you discover it**? If you know the name of a band you&#8217;re interested in: no problem, just Google it. But how do you cruise trough that uncharted territory, that immense backcatalogue of undiscovered music. It&#8217;s not easy, you could list Amazon or iTunes least popular songs (I doubt they have that option, though), but the stuff that&#8217;s on there and that&#8217;s not popular, is usually unpopular for a reason.

There used to be Pandora, and for Americans, it&#8217; still exists. You type in a song or artist you like and it will start playing stuff that sounds a bit like it. For a long time, we, Europeans and other rejects, didn&#8217;t have any resort to go on a journey of musical discovery.

But there is one outlet, often overlooked, but it has been building tremendous momentum. **It&#8217;s called <a title="Last.fm" href="http://www.last.fm/" target="_blank">Last.fm</a>**. Started as a plugin for various mp3 players (remember <a title="Winamp media player" href="http://www.winamp.com/" target="_blank">Winamp</a>?) to track you listening habits, it now uses that gigantic amount of information to make suggestions. Like something, open up the associated radio station and you&#8217;ll get tons of good stuff.

Some good starting points:

  * <a title="John Coltrane radio on Last.fm" href="http://www.last.fm/listen/artist/John%2BColtrane/similarartists" target="_blank">John Coltrane radio</a>
  * <a title="Banco de Gaia radio on Last.fm" href="http://www.last.fm/listen/artist/Banco%2Bde%2BGaia/similarartists" target="_blank">Banco de Gaia radio</a>
  * <a title="Eat Static radio on Last.fm" href="http://www.last.fm/listen/artist/Eat%2BStatic/similarartists" target="_blank">Eat Static radio</a> (probably not every one&#8217;s taste, but try it out for just a few tracks and see if you like it)

My main criticism is that Last.fm doesn&#8217;t include all the truly little guys, those slaving away at home, making brilliant music and offering it for free. They just aren&#8217;t popular enough to get into the Last.fm&#8217;s statistics. I&#8217;d love to see something similar with <a title="Audio - Creative Commons" href="http://creativecommons.org/audio/" target="_blank">CC artists</a> mixed in (also see those <a title="Bits are meant to be free - the Creative Commons licenses" href="http://www.streamhead.com/bits-meant-free-creative-commons-licenses/" target="_blank">previous</a> <a title="Free Music Over Here, Served the Oldskool Way" href="http://www.streamhead.com/free-music-served-oldskool/" target="_blank">posts</a>).

What artists do you like? How do you get your fix of unknown music?
