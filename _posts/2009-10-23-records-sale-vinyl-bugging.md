<a title="Vinyl, the choice and some Astralasia musings" href="http://www.streamhead.com/vinyl-the-choice-and-some-astralasia-musings/" target="_blank">A long time ago, I decided it was about time I got rid of all my vinyl records</a>. I have a very modest collection containing mostly very high quality 12&#8243; LPs. But my collection is just too small and my turntable too old that in practice, I hardly ever listen to them. It&#8217;s too bad, because the music is brilliant.

After I decided to sell off my LPs, almost 2 years ago, I sold exactly one record. Sad but true, I procrastinated and in the end nothing happened. There are some memories associated with some records, so those might be a little painful to sell, but most of them, I&#8217;ve only played a few times over the years.

So here&#8217;s to second chances. First up, are my Orbital records, those hold, for me at least, the least value, because I have them all on CD, so it&#8217;s not like I won&#8217;t be able to listen to the tracks again. There&#8217;s some good stuff in there so if you are interested, why not take a look.

The should appear on <a title="Orbital records" href="http://shop.benl.ebay.be/kbaxter_be/m.html?_nkw=&_armrs=1&_from=&_ipg=&_trksid=p3686" target="_blank">my eBay page</a>, but right now, that doesn&#8217;t seem to be working. So here are the individual LPs:

  * <a title="Orbital - Are We Here?" href="http://cgi.benl.ebay.be/ws/eBayISAPI.dll?ViewItem&item=300359821341&ssPageName=STRK:MESELX:IT" target="_blank">Are We Here?</a> (including Rabbit in the Moon mixes)
  * <a title="Orbital -Are We Here? mixes" href="http://cgi.benl.ebay.be/ws/eBayISAPI.dll?ViewItem&item=300359821360&ssPageName=STRK:MESELX:IT" target="_blank">Are We Here? mixes</a> (this one includes a very disturbing special print, if I find the time, I&#8217;ll scan it)
  * <a title="Orbital - Chime" href="http://cgi.benl.ebay.be/ws/eBayISAPI.dll?ViewItem&item=300359821381&ssPageName=STRK:MESELX:IT" target="_blank">Chime, the remixes</a>
  * <a title="Orbital - III" href="http://cgi.benl.ebay.be/ws/eBayISAPI.dll?ViewItem&item=300359821408&ssPageName=STRK:MESELX:IT" target="_blank">III</a>
  * <a title="Orbital - Omen" href="http://cgi.benl.ebay.be/ws/eBayISAPI.dll?ViewItem&item=300359821427&ssPageName=STRK:MESELX:IT" target="_blank">Omen</a>
  * <a title="Orbital - Radiccio 1" href="http://cgi.benl.ebay.be/ws/eBayISAPI.dll?ViewItem&item=300359821440&ssPageName=STRK:MESELX:IT" target="_blank">Radiccio 1</a> (every one even remotely interested in Orbital should hear the tracks on this one: Halcyon and The Naked And The Dub)

There you have it, a little piece of history that has been in my closet for too long. If you buy them, please play the records a little more then I did.
