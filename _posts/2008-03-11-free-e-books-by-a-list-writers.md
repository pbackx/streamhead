&#8220;Despite all our propaganda attempts to convince you otherwise, AI is alarmingly easy to produce; the human brain isn&#8217;t unique, it isn&#8217;t well-tuned, and you don&#8217;t need eighty billion neurons joined in an asynchronous network to generate consciousness. And although it looks like a good idea to a naive observer, in practice it&#8217;s absolutely deadly.&#8221;

Antibodies &#8211; Charles Stross

Every since [Lawrence Lessig](http://www.lessig.org/)&#8216;s &#8220;[The future of ideas](http://the-future-of-ideas.com/)&#8221; and the [Creative Commons](http://creativecommons.org/) movement, different writers have been experimenting with different ways of offering you, dear reader, free books. And it is of course you that profits, as long as you don&#8217;t mind reading a book on the screen. If you plan on reading the [dead tree edition](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Dead_tree_edition), I would suggest the library, bookstore, or company printer.

As it sort-of fits the subject, you will find mostly Science Fiction and in particular cyberpunk on the net. The most prolific author is undoubtedly [Cory Doctorow](http://www.craphound.com/), who offers all his books for download.

You might have guessed it by the intro, but also [Charles Stross](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Charles_Stross) has shared one of his books, [Accelerando](http://www.accelerando.org/). The book is certainly worth the read, although you might find it a bit dated in some aspects. I guess that&#8217;s the danger with cyberpunk, reality catches up pretty fast. For Charles, this free book was a one-time occurrence. Maybe the book didn&#8217;t sell that well due to downloads, maybe he prefers to only offer paper versions? In any case, he does have [an interesting weblog](http://www.antipope.org/charlie/blog-static/index.html) if you want more free reading material.
