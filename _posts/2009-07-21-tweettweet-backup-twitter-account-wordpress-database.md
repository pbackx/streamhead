One thing that has been bothering me with social services is the difficulty of creating a backup. What would happen if Twitter suddenly dissapeared, or even worse, what would you do without your Delicious bookmarks? It has happened a few times before, services like Geocities and Stick-it were closed almost over night (I&#8217;m exagerating, but if you are on holidays in the wrong period, you might come back to see your data gone)

<a title="6 Steps to Obtain the Perfect Backup" href="http://www.streamhead.com/backups/" target="_blank">Backups of your local system are important</a>, but so are backups of remote systems. Although people tend to thrust third parties a lot more, most of them don&#8217;t offer any kind of data guarantee. Certainly if you&#8217;re not paying for the service, there&#8217;s very little you can do if your data is gone.

Twitter is certainly a bad offender for me. Although I haven&#8217;t been tweeting that much lately, <a title="Peter Backx on Twitter" href="http://twitter.com/pbackx" target="_blank">I do try to share interesting insights and valueable sites</a>, so I don&#8217;t want to see those go. So when I saw <a title="Tweet Tweet" href="http://ocaoimh.ie/tweet-tweet/" target="_blank">&#8220;Tweet Tweet&#8221;</a>, a WordPress plugin to backup your tweets, I was immediately charmed. I noticed it hasn&#8217;t been updates in a while, but I think it is the only plugin that actually stores a backup copy of your Tweets.

As an added extra, you can integrate the tweets in your blog. Which I&#8217;ll probably do at some point, when I get around to updating the layout.

Have fun and don&#8217;t forget to backup.
