If I&#8217;d like to learn something new, certainly some new technology, I always like to learn by example. Having a goal to create something specific is, for me, much more motivating than leaving through a book one page at a time.

For instance, Timo has <a title="Plane game (PV3D + WOW)" href="http://www.timovirtanen.com/?p=216" target="_blank">a nice example of Papervision 3D and the WOW physics engine</a>. It gives both a very short introduction to <a title="Papervision3D" href="http://blog.papervision3d.org/" target="_blank">Papervision 3D</a>, which is probably the leading 3D engine for Flash, and <a title="AS3 3D Physics Engine" href="http://seraf.mediabox.fr/wow-engine/as3-3d-physics-engine-wow-engine/" target="_blank">the WOW engine</a>, a great free ActionScript 3 physics engine that plugs in pretty much any framework available.

There are a few issues with Timo&#8217;s code if you download it. For instance, it is missing an important Flash resource. A small movie that has a game timer in there that shows you how well you are doing. I got rid of it and replaced it with a simple texture, so no more game time. There are also a bunch of warning, which I just choose to ignore (turned of AS3 warnings in FlashDevelop&#8217;s compiler options).

Apart from that, you&#8217;ll also need to download the libraries. To ease your work a little, I&#8217;ve done all the hard work for you. I&#8217;ve put everything into a FlashDevelop project and got the libraries from their Subversion repositories. So here&#8217;s a truly cutting edge workspace to get your started:
