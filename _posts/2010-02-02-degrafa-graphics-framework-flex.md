Flex and ActionScript combined give you a very powerful environment for programming graphics intensive application. The technology makes it easy to design and create animation rich interfaces. And now Degrafa adds yet another compelling choice if you want to easily create complex graphical interfaces.

<!--more-->

In Flex, many graphics operations require knowledge of ActionScript. <a title="Degrafa : Declarative Graphics Framework" href="http://www.degrafa.org/about/" target="_blank">Degrafa</a> allows you to decoratively specify those programs in the Flex MXML files that define graphic interfaces. Designers can thus more easily create and comprehend programs, while developers don&#8217;t need to switch back to ActionScript for many operations (or even complete programs).

Degrafa is open source and thus <a title="download Degrafa" href="http://www.degrafa.org/code/" target="_blank">freely available</a>.
