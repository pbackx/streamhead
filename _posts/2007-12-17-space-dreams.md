[![interlacing oh yeah](http://www.streamhead.com/wp-content/uploads/2007/12/wc4_005.thumbnail.png)](http://www.streamhead.com/wp-content/uploads/2007/12/wc4_005.png "interlacing oh yeah")

One thing to note about Wing Commander IV (see previous post) is its use of live-action [full motion video](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Full_motion_video). For a short while, it was popular to use real actors (usually not the good kind) to produce the cut-scenes in video-games. Developers dreamed of creating &#8220;interactive movies&#8221;. They wanted to be the directors of the 21th century. But somehow, the people thought differently. The games that use real actors nowadays are far between (any one know one released in 2007?).

Also noteworthy is the interlacing that was used (click the thumbnail above to see it). Lots of tricks were needed, back then, to show the user a video of sort-of acceptable quality. The quality didn&#8217;t convince really. It was the novelty that did.

Maybe it&#8217;s time for a small live-action revival. I can&#8217;t imagine those actors are more expensive then the team of graphic animators that is needed these days.

If I peaked your interest in Wing Commander IV, I&#8217;m selling an surplus one I have lying around on eBay. I&#8217;m shipping international, but if you search you might find a cheaper local supplier, I don&#8217;t hold grudges over stuff like that.<a href="http://rover.ebay.com/rover/1/1553-22136-8894-15/1?aid=10380922&pid=2770404" target="_top"><br /> <img style="background: white;" src="http://www.awltovhc.com/image-2770404-10380922" border="0" alt="http://www.ebay.be" width="100" height="100" /></a>
