First of all, I&#8217;m sorry this is going to be a short post with no pictures or researched links, but you know how it goes around Christmas.

If you do need a little relaxation during those busy days, I recommend Sam&Max. If you&#8217;re feeling adventurous, get yourself the old one, from way back. If you&#8217;re less inclined to take a risk. Boot up Steam (you do have it, don&#8217;t you?) and order yourself the first season. It includes 6 games, each about 2 to 3 hours playtime. At least if you&#8217;re new to this adventure genre. Some people will probably finish it a lot sooner. But I&#8217;d suggest to take your time and enjoy the waky humor.

It&#8217;s Black Adder, but interactive.
