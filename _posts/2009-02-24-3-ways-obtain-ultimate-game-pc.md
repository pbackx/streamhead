Gaming on PC is a though job. You&#8217;re faced with continuously upgrading your machine to keep up with the latest technology and games. There are a few ways to obtain that ultimate machine, but the most important question you&#8217;ll face is how to keep it affordable. I have a few options to offer you.

The last upgrade to my PC was too many years ago. At that time, I got myself the most expensive GeForce 6800 card and was set for a few years. While it was an expensive upgrade, I must say it has served me well. At least until about a year ago. Now my machine is falling apart and urgently needs upgrades, or maybe maybe even a replacement.

So that&#8217;s why I started investigating. In fact, there are 3 options if you want an up-to-date gaming system:

  * **Buy a pre-build system**. There are many PC out there, specifically build for gaming. <a title="Alienware desktop pc's" href="http://www.alienware.com/products/desktop-computers.aspx" target="_blank">Alienware</a> is one of the most known brands. They all have two things in common, they have a distinct look (cool or gaudy, depending in your taste) and <a title="Top 10 game PC's" href="http://www.gamez.nl/special/6124/special--top-10-game-pc---s.html" target="_blank">they&#8217;re <strong>terribly expensive</strong></a> (Dutch site, but you should get the gist of it).
  * **Upgrade your system**. Replace one or two components in your existing machine to bring it back up-to-date. If you can make it work, this is certainly the **cheapest** option. There are a few gotchas though. If you have an older system, it&#8217;s not always easy or possible to replace parts with newer ones. You run the risk of investing in ancient technology, because that&#8217;s the only thing that will work with your current configuration. So be careful when you choose, for instance, the bus technology for your new video card. Make sure it is future proof, else you&#8217;ll be paying a lot of money for something that will only last one more year.
  * Replace your system with **a custom build**. Not every one will feel comfortable building his own system, but you can find a good dealer that will build it for you, either for free or a low price. At least you have full control over the cost of your new machine.

I&#8217;ve made <a title="Game PC specs" href="http://spreadsheets.google.com/ccc?key=plbaq96CLh7aXpCPigcQqDQ" target="_blank">a little <strong>spreadsheet to compare</strong> the parts that are usually put in those <strong>expensive machines to a reasonably priced</strong> very-ok-ish <strong>game machine</strong></a>. I haven&#8217;t entered details on hard disk drives, cases and other drives, because those are very personal choices. You&#8217;ll notice that, yes, in fact, those expensive machines use expensive parts, but it&#8217;s very possible to get <a title="Extremetech $800 game PC" href="http://www.extremetech.com/article2/0,2845,2271000,00.asp" target="_blank">a good PC for good money</a>.

You might also notice that, unless you have recent machine, many of those new parts won&#8217;t fit. Intel slot 775 is a pretty recent standard, but any gamer agrees that&#8217;s the processor family to go for. So you&#8217;ll need that new motherboard. You&#8217;ll probably need it anyway for that new PCI-e graphics card anyway.

And if you need even more choices, you should check out the forums at Tom&#8217;s hardware, like <a title="Guide to choosing parts" href="http://www.tomshardware.co.uk/forum/page-257075_13_0.html" target="_blank">this guide on picking parts</a>. Good luck with those choices! And afterwards, <a title="the ultimate game room" href="http://www.pcmag.com/article2/0,1895,1935974,00.asp" target="_blank">this is next</a>.
