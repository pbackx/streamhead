<a title="Processing 1.0 (BETA)" href="http://processing.org/" target="_blank">Processing</a> is an open source programming language and environment, specifically for animation and interaction. <a title="Beautiful processing artwork" href="http://vimeo.com/658158" target="_blank">Impressive</a> things are possible, such as this <a title="Advanced Beauty" href="http://advancedbeauty.org/blog/" target="_blank">Advanced Beauty</a>.

I must say it all looked pretty arty-farty: &#8220;Advanced Beauty is an ongoing exploration of digital artworks born and influenced by sound,Â an ever-growing collaboration between programmers, artists, musicians, animators and architects.&#8221; But after seeing the trailer, I was a believer.

As of yesterday, they have begun sending 18 works of art onto the Internet. You can follow <a title="Advanced beaut transmissions" href="http://advancedbeauty.org/blog/video-index" target="_blank">their website</a> or subscribe yourself via iTunes or even order them on disc later on. The choice is yours, just don&#8217;t miss it.
