LEGO, Star Wars, free and games. What could be better than combining those four. Not much! <a title="LEGO Star Wars: The Quest for R2-D2" href="Since this is a browser-based game and it's free," target="_blank">The new LEGO Star Wars game has it all</a>. The Quest for R2-D2 is a completely free game that you will love. It isn&#8217;t quite as deep as the full games, such as <a title="LEGO Star Wars II: The Original Trilogy" href="http://www.mobygames.com/game/gamecube/lego-star-wars-ii-the-original-trilogy" target="_blank">the original trilogy</a>, but the quality is incredible for a browser-based game that is free. Chances are low you&#8217;ve seen anything comparable in a browser.

I would suggest that you go out and try the game, but if you want more analysis, <a title="LEGO Star Wars: The Quest for R2-D2 at Jay is Games" href="http://jayisgames.com/archives/2009/10/lego_star_wars_the_quest_for_r2d2.php" target="_blank">Jay is Games has it</a>.

What is interesting for me as a developer is the fact that this is one more game that uses the <a title="UNITY: Game Development Tool" href="http://unity3d.com/" target="_blank">Unity game development toolkit</a>. Over the last year I&#8217;ve seen it popup in several different places. And most developers seem to be pretty happy with their choice.

Unity is basically a toolkit for creating interactive 3D worlds. Obviously games are the primary purpose. It&#8217;s based around a graphical editor, but it allows for deep scripting and customization (such as custom shaders). Once created, the game can be deployed to a multitude of platforms. Either as a native Windows or Mac application, in a browser or even on the iPhone.

More stuff to try.
