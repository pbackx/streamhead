Ok, ok, the title is hyperbole to draw your attention. I&#8217;m not quite ready yet to throw out Java, JavaScript, ActionScript and the other languages I write about on this blog. But what I can say, I&#8217;m charmed. My very first babysteps into the <a title="Python" href="http://www.python.org/" target="_blank">Python</a> language have convinced me that it&#8217;s certainly worth pursuing.

<!--more-->I recently began studying Python for a few reasons, mostly because I thought it was about time I did. Both Python and Ruby have been on my &#8220;want to learn those&#8221; list for a long long time. And since &#8220;

[Programming in Python 3](http://www.amazon.co.uk/gp/product/0321680561?ie=UTF8&tag=watje-21&linkCode=as2&camp=1634&creative=19450&creativeASIN=0321680561)<img style="border:none !important; margin:0px !important;" src="http://www.assoc-amazon.co.uk/e/ir?t=watje-21&l=as2&o=2&a=0321680561" border="0" alt="" width="1" height="1" />&#8221; arrived on my doorstep last week, the decision was quickly made.

I&#8217;m not quite at <a title="Python" href="http://xkcd.com/353/" target="_blank">xkcd</a> levels yet, but I can certainly see glimpses of it already:

<a rel="attachment wp-att-2370" href="http://www.streamhead.com/drinking-the-python-kool-aid/xkcd_python/"><img class="alignnone size-full wp-image-2370" title="xkcd_python" src="http://www.streamhead.com/wp-content/uploads/2010/06/xkcd_python.bmp" alt="" width="404" height="459" /></a>

So what is so special about Python? Here are some of the things that I thought are interesting from the get-go:

  * If you grew up on C, moved to C++ and are now programming Java or C#, you&#8217;ll immediately notice the almost complete **absence of punctuations**. There are no semi colons, no curly braces, only a few colons here and there. It&#8217;s a lot of, almost, useless overhead you won&#8217;t have to worry about. The reason this works is &#8230;
  * **Indentation is important**. Code blocks (called &#8220;suites&#8221; in Python) are not surrounded by curly braces, but are indented the right amount. You&#8217;re free to choose the exact amount of indentation, so there is some flexibility, but no matter how you look at it, it certainly is strange at first.
  * When programming Python, you don&#8217;t define variables before you use them, you don&#8217;t declare their type and you can store objects of different types using the same variable. Variables, or **object references are very flexible**.
  * Yet, in spite of those 3 major differences with most traditional, static-typed languages most Python programs have a very **familiar** feeling. You feel right at home.

If I haven&#8217;t convinced you yet, Python is a language worth looking into, there are two more reasons why you might like to check it out. <a title="Zope" href="http://www.zope.org/" target="_blank">Zope</a> and <a title="Django" href="http://www.djangoproject.com/" target="_blank">Django</a>, both are top notch web frameworks that scream to be tested.
