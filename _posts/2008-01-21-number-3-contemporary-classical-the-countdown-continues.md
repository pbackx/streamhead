The top 10 continues, with a spot for contemporary classical music. You know, [Philip Glass](http://www.philipglass.com/) and the likes. Many artists offer an impressive amount of samples on their site. Check out Glass&#8217;s site, or for instance the [Sequenza21](http://www.sequenza21.com/) [listening room](http://www.netnewmusic.net/wiki/index.php?title=Listening_Room). However, finding a continuous mix of music is quite hard.

One of my top recommendations is [Ina](http://www.ina.fr/)&#8216;s [Les Ondes GRM Webradio](http://www.ina.fr/sites/ina.fr/medias/upload/grm/webradio/WebRadio_V_3.1.4.html). The dedication that went into annotating the different episodes makes the usage a flash interface excusable (I usually prefer to just load the stations in my foobar2000 player). Knowledge of French will heighten your experience, but it&#8217;s easy to skip interviews.

There&#8217;s a lot more out there, just take a look at [this contemporary music web radio program list](http://www.geocities.com/weeklycontemporary/), however, not many stations feature it throughout the day.

So that finally brings us to my personal favorite, [Iridian Radio](http://www.iridianradio.com/). Without a doubt it offers the best selection of contemporary music. Again I have to break one of my rules, because it features an unhealthy amount of adds (for a streaming radio station, that is). In spite of that fact, it still is a most excellent radio station.
