<a title="The Codex of Alchemical Engineering" href="http://www.kongregate.com/games/krispykrem/the-codex-of-alchemical-engineering/" target="_blank">The Codex of Alchemical Engineering</a> is a strange little game. Some will find this the greatest game to come along in a long time. Others will not understand its attraction and will probably find playing it a chore. Don&#8217;t worry if you&#8217;re in either category, tastes differ.

<!--more-->The Codex is all about programming robotic arms. The hardcore way. This is not some kind of user friendly simulation, it is how factories work. Well, sort of, but it gets close. Your goal is to produce molecules. You&#8217;ve got a few sources of simple atoms and have to put them in different devices to create the desired end result.

It all sounds like chemistry, but it really isn&#8217;t. It&#8217;s robotics and it will keep you busy for the rest of the night.
