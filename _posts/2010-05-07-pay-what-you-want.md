<a title="The Humble Indie Bundle" href="http://www.wolfire.com/humble" target="_blank">The Humble Indie Bundle</a> is the latest example of a growing trend: You&#8217;re free to set your own price. The Humble Indie Bundle contains 5 great indie games that would usually retail for about $80, but you get to choose your own price. Looking at the current statistics, the average is way below that price.

<!--more-->Of course, there are a few reasons for that. One is that people can anonymously choose their price. There&#8217;s really no social control, so obviously you can&#8217;t expect people at their best. But another reason is that most of the games have been out for a while. World of Goo, the most known of the bunch has been available for a few years and has also been featured in other bundles and, I think, in a few Steam specials.

But don&#8217;t see it that way, if there&#8217;s even just one of those great games you&#8217;re missing, you should really consider given a correct amount for this bundle. As an added benefit, you can also support the Child&#8217;s Play charity.
