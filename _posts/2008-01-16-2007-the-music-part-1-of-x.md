I didn&#8217;t buy much music last year, however, the few things I did buy are almost all worth mentioning. Lets start with Trentem√∏ller&#8217;s late 2007 electro-ish double CD. I still like to have something real in my hands, so I bought the CD, but &#8220;The Trentemoller chronicles&#8221; is also available from [Beatport](http://www.beatport.com).

It is kind of hard to define Trentemoller&#8217;s music. &#8220;Electro&#8221; really doesn&#8217;t do him much justice. You can find many samples on [his myspace site](http://www.myspace.com/trentemoeller) if you want to investigate and listen, before buying. It does give a good feel of what he&#8217;s all about.

Some of his more relaxed, ambient if-you-will, work is missing there though. And it&#8217;s a pity. The chronicles start of really relaxed and only evolve towards his better known dancefloor style in the second part. In contrast, the second disc of the set goes all out. While the first one is Trentemoller&#8217;s own work, the second is a selection of remixes he did. Most notably for me is Djuma Soundsystem&#8217;s &#8220;Les Djinns&#8221;. Classic.

If you want more in depth reviews for trainspotters, I would suggest [the one at Pitchfork](http://www.pitchforkmedia.com/article/record_review/46338-the-trentemller-chronicles) or [on Resident Advisor](http://www.residentadvisor.net/review-view.aspx?id=4878). They are right, many tracks are very well known, maybe a bit too well and have already been released. But if you&#8217;re not a DJ, I doubt you will have many of them and this chronicle is the ideal way to get your collection up-to-date.
