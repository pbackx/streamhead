Today marks my 6 year blogging anniversary. I usually don&#8217;t mention those kind of birthdays much, but what the heck &#8230; lets be nostalgic for once.

My first blog was hosted at <a title="watje . about trance - the start" href="http://radio.weblogs.com/0118796/2003/01/23.html" target="_blank">Radio Userland</a> and, against all odds, is still somehow online. Userland used to be true pioneers, but it looks like they forgot to innovate. I still believe they have a strong offering. Compared to pretty much all other blogging packages, they have a real content-centric approach, which makes it very different. But compared to WordPress, there really is no community to speak of.

Afterwards I did a short stint on my selfhosted Blojsom blog, until I found my true calling, right here, on Streamhead.

And before blogging, I have had a web pressence for as long as I can remember. Sadly, the traces of that are almost gone. <a title="Internet Archive of pbackx" href="http://web.archive.org/web/*/http://studwww.rug.ac.be/~pbackx" target="_blank">The Internet Archive has a few</a>, but looking at the first page, it&#8217;s clear that I used to already have some sort of site in 1996. The university I was at back then renamed their servers and I really can&#8217;t remember what it used to be called before. Most of my early sites were very graphic intensive (no dialup for me, I was on a university network), so you won&#8217;t get much value from the Internet Archive.

1996 seems both distant and close. It&#8217;s weird. It was the time when I discovered the Internet (and in particular, the World Wide Web). I can&#8217;t remember clearly, but I believe Internet only got really big in about 1998. So the first few years were strange. There still were other things than the WWW, like newsgroups, IRC and telnet <a title="MUD - Wikipedia" href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/MUD" target="_blank">MUD</a>s. But one by one we saw all of them disappear. In 1996, there was no Google, it&#8217;s very hard to believe, but it was all about Yahoo!, Hotbot and Altavista. Strange and wonderful times.

Even before that, I was online, I had a little BBS called &#8220;Virtual Hell&#8221; (yes, really). <a title="The Belgian Scene Report issue 7 - by me, myself and I" href="http://cd.textfiles.com/scene96-1/diskmags/english/bsr/bsr_0007/bsr%230007.mag" target="_blank">Very few traces remain of that</a>. I&#8217;m really going to have to look through my CD backups one day. Maybe in a few years.
