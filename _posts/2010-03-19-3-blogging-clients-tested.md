I&#8217;m currently testing a number of blogging clients. Clients that free you from the web browser for post writing and editing. This is a post written in and posted via <a href="http://www.zoundryraven.com/" target="_blank" title="Zoundry Raven: Think - Write - Publish">Zoundry Raven</a>. Among the many blogging clients available, I&#8217;ve selected three for closer inspection: the aforementioned <a href="http://www.zoundryraven.com/" target="_blank" title="Zoundry Raven: Think - Write - Publish">Raven</a>, <a href="http://www.blogdesk.org/en/index.htm" target="_blank" title="BlogDesk">BlogDesk</a> and <a href="http://www.scribefire.com/" target="_blank" title="Scribefire: Fire up your blogging">Scribefire</a>. The last one is an add-on for Firefox, the first two are standalone Windows applications. All support pretty much every blogging platform available. This post goes into some of the differences.

Pro:

  * This is a Firefox plug-in. And that is both a good and a bad thing.
  * Conceptually, integrating an editor in my favorite browser looks like a winner. I&#8217;ve got all my prefered plug-ins and on-line tools right there, so this sounds like a winner.

Against:

  * This is a Firefox plug-in. And that is both a good and a bad thing.
  * The interface is a mess. I tested this plug-in a few years ago, but the interface doesn&#8217;t seem to have evolved much. I&#8217;m not sure if this is a technical reason (it&#8217;s build on XUL) or laziness.
  * The integration really isn&#8217;t quite as I imagined. I&#8217;m not sure what I expected, but certainly a little more than a Technorati search.
  * Really, the interface. Buttons are all over the place. Most elements aren&#8217;t properly aligned which gives a cluttered impression.

## <a href="http://www.blogdesk.org/" target="_blank" title="BlogDesk">BlogDesk</a>

Pro:

  * BlogDesk offers a fairly intuitive one-window interface with every option you need close-by.
  * An extensive image wizard, with which you can create some pretty neat effects, right out of the box. No PhotoShop needed.
  * Post templates. I haven&#8217;t tested this feature yet, but this could be mighty useful if you publish a series of articles or regularly returning special features.
  * It&#8217;s possible to add custom fields to a post on a WordPress blogs.

Against:

  * No multi document interface. For me, this is a fairly major drawback, as I tend to work on many things at once. You can save draft posts, but they aren&#8217;t easily browsable.

  * Raven has great content management options. First, there&#8217;s a specialized explorer-like interface to quickly manage blog posts (published and drafts), links, images and tags. And secondly, you can add a number of media storage sources. I haven&#8217;t experimented with this feature yet, but it looks promising.
  * Recently, Raven has been open sourced. It&#8217;s a Python application that is freely available from Google Code. The disadvantage is that the original creators no longer have time to seriously work on the application.

Against:

  * There&#8217;s a pretty annoying bug where you can&#8217;t insert H2 and other header tags in the WYSIWYG editor. You can still use the XHTML editor to add them, but in a tool this good, this little blemish stands out.
  * Sometimes, the interface isn&#8217;t very intuitive. For instance, if you want to schedule a post for future publishing, you need to click on the &#8220;configure&#8221; drop-down and select the appropriate tab. Not very intuitive at all.

There&#8217;s still one thing missing in all of these editors, and that is the possibility to add a thumbnail. Since version 2.9, WordPress has implemented a standardized way of adding a thumbnail to a post. Something that I solved via custom fields, but that never felt right. So I was happy to implement the thumbnails in the new design. Too bad, none of the clients support this (probably with very good reason, this isn&#8217;t exactly anything standardized).

So for now, I&#8217;m in a limbo, either set the thumbnail manually every time, or not use the thumbnail functionality at all.

But one thing is sure, typing in a proper text entry application is truly a relief from the on-line editor.

Do you have a preferred blog editor?
