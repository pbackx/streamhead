Don&#8217;t believe girlfriends and eternal pessimists and naysayers. Lego is cool and you are allowed to play with until you hair turns gray and even long after that. Let me convince you with a little video.


  
[Living in Meatspace â€” Gizmodo and Lego Go Miniman Go Contest](http://vimeo.com/1583302) from [Jesus Diaz](http://vimeo.com/user695393) on [Vimeo](http://vimeo.com)

It&#8217;s part of <a title="Gizmodo's Lego Minifig Contest" href="http://gizmodo.com/5040808/gizs-lego-minifig-contest-win-the-best-vintage-sets-ever" target="_blank">the Gizmodo Go Legoman Go contest</a> and was published some time ago. But I love the humor, so I thought it needed a few extra viewers. I actually was going to participate in the contest, but I ended up with too little time to add all the sounds that would have made my entry perfect. There will be some interesting posts about it, so it&#8217;s not all lost.
