There have been many attempts at creating an ideal world and there have been many more at **thinking up how that perfect world should look like**. **Ayn Rand** attacks the problem from the inside out. Starting with **the perfect man**.

<a title="Scott H Young - Review of the Fountainhead and Atlas Shrugged" href="http://www.scotthyoung.com/blog/2008/01/14/review-of-the-fountainhead-and-atlas-shrugged/" target="_blank">Via Scott Young&#8217;s blog</a>, I found out about Ayn Rand and her books. Last month I read **<a title="Buy Ayn Rand - The Fountainhead from Amazon.co.uk" href="http://www.amazon.co.uk/gp/product/0141188626?ie=UTF8&tag=watje-21&linkCode=as2&camp=1634&creative=19450&creativeASIN=0141188626" target="_blank">The Fountainhead</a>**. Actually, I listened to <a title="The Fountainhead audio book on amazon" href="http://www.amazon.co.uk/gp/product/0786189657?ie=UTF8&tag=watje-21&linkCode=as2&camp=1634&creative=19450&creativeASIN=0786189657" target="_blank">the audio book</a> (it&#8217;s cheaper on <a title="Download The Fountainhead - Ayn Rand" href="http://www.audible.com/adbl/site/products/ProductDetail.jsp?productID=BK_BLAK_002398&BV_UseBVCookie=Yes" target="_blank">Audible</a>) in my car. If it wasn&#8217;t for the audio book, I probably would have never finished it. Especially the first part is a little too slow in my opinion and it&#8217;s in the last two parts that Ayn Rand&#8217;s vision of the perfect man becomes clearer. The least I can say is, that it&#8217;s interesting. It does raise questions which you&#8217;ll probably like to think about. While it might be a bit slow in parts, I&#8217;d still recommend it to any one interested in thinking about a perfect world with perfect people.
