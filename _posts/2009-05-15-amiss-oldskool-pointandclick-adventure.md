Over the next few weeks, I&#8217;ll be featuring a bunch of Flash games that have been in my backlog for a long time now. As some of you might know already, I am a great admirer of the new wave of almost-professional free games. They are a great way to experiment with new media and show of your skills. Many of the games go well beyond simple hobby project, and I truly hope the creators can earn a living with them.

&#8220;<a title="Something Amiss - The free online adventure game" href="http://www.somethingamiss.com/" target="_blank">Something Amiss</a>&#8221; is a perfect example of this. Over at least 2 years, the creator, <a title="Tucker Bowen demo reel" href="http://www.somethingamiss.com/tuckerbowen/" target="_blank">Tucker Bowen</a> has been working on a great point-and-click adventure. It steps in the footsteps of many great predecessors. The games nicely ramp up, with the first chapter serving more as an introduction to adventure games.

If you get stuck, I suggest you don&#8217;t give up too soon, but if you need a few hints, <a title="Something Amiss walkthroughs on Jay is Games" href="http://jayisgames.com/tag/somethingamiss" target="_blank">Jay is Games has full walkthroughs for all the chapters</a>.

Enjoy!
