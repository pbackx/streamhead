Need a small online app for tracking customer data? Want to automate some of that manual paper work? Ready to move beyond Excel and Access?

Streamhead now offers **cheap web app development for $199** on the following platforms (or let us decide based on your wishes and resources):

  * Node.JS (with RailwayJS or framework of choice)
  * Java WAR with Vaadin (deployable on Heroku, Jelastic or any web container)
  * AppEngine/Java with Vaadin
  * WordPress plugin (in PHP, of course)
  * Plain PHP (framework can be discussed, e.g. CakePHP or Symfony)

One example web app can be seen at [expensesspreadsheet.net](http://www.expensesspreadsheet.net/ "Track your expenses"). This includes:

  * Facebook authentication.
  * One entity (expenses) stored in a MongoDB NoSQL database.
  * Twitter Bootstrap templates.

This is a fully functioning application, however it is no Google Docs or Basecamp. It&#8217;s more a minimum viable product and a solid foundation to build on.

The fine print:

  * Cost: $199
  * Turnaround time: 1 to 2 weeks
  * Fully customized
  * Create/read/update/delete forms for one entity (eg. a recipe, a financial transaction, etc.)
  * Two business rules (eg. totals, constraints)
  * Heroku support for Java and Node.JS / PHP will run on any shared host
