Streamhead, the blog, is completely free to all. However, I put a lot of my spare time into creating quality content. Over the last few months, I&#8217;ve been improving the articles, making them better, longer and more practical. While this means better articles, this also means a lot more work for me.

I hope you like this new and improved Streamhead.

In addition, due to increased traffic, I&#8217;m also running into the limits of my current shared hosting plan. This has required me to make a few hosting upgrades.

To offset both of those additional costs, I&#8217;ve decided to offer a few &#8220;premium&#8221; services. Those are not necessary to fully enjoy Streamhead, nor do I expect you to buy them. If you like what you see and you have a use for the services I&#8217;m offering, by all means, go for it. But I won&#8217;t hold it against you if you never buy a thing from me.

Right now services are priced well bellow market value. I expect this to change, so don&#8217;t be surprised if you see prices increase with demand.

Enjoy the discounts while you can.

Peter
