Inspired by [Derek Sivers now page](http://sivers.org/now), here’s what I am doing right now (last update April 2024):

* [Working as a freelancer, helping my clients tame their data](https://www.linkedin.com/in/pbackx/).
* Preparing to work on [an awesome startup project](https://www.longyan.io/) during the summer.
* [Reading](https://www.goodreads.com/user/show/37577599-peter-backx). One goal is to read all [Dune novels](http://www.dunenovels.com/). I am currently on [The Battle of Corrin](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Dune:_The_Battle_of_Corrin). While I can certainly understand the different opinions on the more recent additions to the Dune universe, I am really enjoying this trilogy.
* Building various robots. One goal for 2024 is to revive [my Lego sorting project](https://www.streamhead.com/3d%20printing/ai/2021/11/01/deep-learning-lego-sorting.html). I am currently overhauling [the complete software stack](https://github.com/pbackx/lego-sorter-pi/).
* [Learning Japanese, 10 minutes a day](https://www.duolingo.com/profile/PeterBackx1). I am also using WaniKani, but I still feel like I am at a plateau. As a challenge, I would like to take up reading manga comics, but I am struggling on how to approach this. I will be posting more thoughts on this on my blog.
* My current videogame rotation: Fortnite, Forza Horizon and some random other things.

What I’m not doing right now:

* Making music. My goal for 2024 is to actually release tracks, even if I am not 100% happy with them. When something is released, it will be right [here](https://soundcloud.com/pete-with-a-p). Because of other priorities (see above), I haven't been able to put much time into making music.
* Organizing my music collection using the awesome [Beets](http://beets.io/). I'm really wondering whether or not I should continue with this. I've been doing almost all my music listening through Google Home and it's very difficult to get your local collections nicely integrated.
* Trying to make [Home Assistant](https://www.home-assistant.io/) manage my home energy. I wanted to make an add-on to optimize energy usage, but the amount of money that could be saved is just so tiny it was not worth the effort.
