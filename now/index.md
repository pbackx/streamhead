Inspired by [Derek Sivers now page](http://sivers.org/now), here’s what I am doing right now (last update August 2021):

* Holiday modus.
* [Working as a freelancer, helping my clients tame their Data](https://www.linkedin.com/in/pbackx/).
* [Reading](https://www.goodreads.com/user/show/37577599-peter-backx). Among others, [the entire Dune saga](http://www.dunenovels.com/). "Sandworms of Dune" is next, but first I have some other books I'd like to finish.
* [Creating and 3D printing useful stuff](https://www.streamhead.com/category/3d_printing.html). I'm currently in the process of writing a long overdue blogpost regarding my latest project where I used 3D printing to make some parts behave nice together. 
* [Learning Japanese, 10 minutes a day](https://www.duolingo.com/profile/PeterBackx1). It's a very slow process.
* I've also been playing more games lately. Fortnite and Minecraft mostly. I really enjoy the things that the community creates for these games. It's impressive how far they can take those engines with their creativity.
* Preparing my [Home Assistant](https://www.home-assistant.io/) install to be migrated to a proper computer. I'm running it on a Raspberry Pi 3, but would like to move it to something more powerful.

What I’m not doing right now:

* Organizing my music collection using the awesome [Beets](http://beets.io/). I'm a perfectionist, so this is going to take some time.
* Building a [voice-controlled](https://aiyprojects.withgoogle.com/voice/) robot. It's still on the back burner.
