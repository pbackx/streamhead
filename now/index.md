Inspired by [Derek Sivers now page](http://sivers.org/now), here’s what I am doing right now (last update August 2021):

* [Working as a freelancer, helping my clients tame their Data](https://www.linkedin.com/in/pbackx/).
* [Reading](https://www.goodreads.com/user/show/37577599-peter-backx). Among others, [the entire Dune saga](http://www.dunenovels.com/). Apart from the books, I'm also enjoying the graphic novel versions. At the moment, the first two books are available. I have finished the main story line ("Sandworms of Dune") and I'm debating on how to tackle the other books. I will probably read them chronologically, so starting with "The Butlerian Jihad".
* Making music. I don't really feel ready to show of anything, but I find it really relaxing, even if it's only short loops just for myself.
* [Learning Japanese, 10 minutes a day](https://www.duolingo.com/profile/PeterBackx1). It's a very slow process.
* I've also been playing more games lately. I'm only a few hours in, but "Immortals: Fenyx Rising" has some very satisfying combat.
* Trying to make [Home Assistant](https://www.home-assistant.io/) manage my home energy. It sounds simple, but there are so many variables involved. I'm sure there are business ideas lurking in there.

What I’m not doing right now:

* Organizing my music collection using the awesome [Beets](http://beets.io/). I'm a perfectionist, so this is going to take some time.
* Building a [voice-controlled](https://aiyprojects.withgoogle.com/voice/) robot. It's still on the back burner.
