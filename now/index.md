Inspired by [Derek Sivers now page](http://sivers.org/now), here’s what I am doing right now (last update December 2022):

* [Working as a freelancer, helping my clients tame their data](https://www.linkedin.com/in/pbackx/).
* Reading](https://www.goodreads.com/user/show/37577599-peter-backx). My [Dune reading project](http://www.dunenovels.com/) has come to a stop for now. The early Brian Herbert books are really hard to get in Dutch and I'm hesitating on whether or not to continue in English. In the mean time, I again reached my reading goal this year.
* Making music. I'm still stuck with a lot of inspiration and not much actual finished music. [Except for this remix that I'm pretty happy with](https://metapop.com/pete-with-a-p/tracks/dannyboystyles-with-a-tempo-mix/264096).
* [Learning Japanese, 10 minutes a day](https://www.duolingo.com/profile/PeterBackx1). It's a very slow process.
* Trying to make [Home Assistant](https://www.home-assistant.io/) manage my home energy. I'm currently working on an add-on that, I hope, will be functional enough to show off in the first quarter of next year.
* My current videogame rotation: Immortals: Fenyx Rising, Fortnite, Fall Guys and Star Citizen.

What I’m not doing right now:

* Organizing my music collection using the awesome [Beets](http://beets.io/). I'm really wondering whether or not I should continue with this. I've been doing almost all my music listening through Google Home and it's very difficult to get your local collections nicely integrated.
* Building various robots. One goal for next year is to revive [my Lego sorting project](https://www.streamhead.com/3d%20printing/ai/2021/11/01/deep-learning-lego-sorting.html).
