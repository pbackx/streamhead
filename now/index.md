Inspired by [Derek Sivers now page](http://sivers.org/now), here’s what I am doing right now (last update January 2025):

* Ready to start a new challenge (more on that later).
* Working on [my latest side-project](https://www.savvyfolders.com/).
* [Reading](https://www.goodreads.com/user/show/37577599-peter-backx). One goal is to read all [Dune novels](http://www.dunenovels.com/). I have finished the Legends of Dune trilogy some time ago and will start on the Great Schools trilogy later this year.
* Building various robots. I have recently done a major overhaul of [my Lego sorting project](https://www.streamhead.com/3d%20printing/ai/2021/11/01/deep-learning-lego-sorting.html) and the results are so good I have plenty of energy to continue improving it.
* [Learning Japanese, 10 minutes a day](https://www.duolingo.com/profile/PeterBackx1). I wasn't able to make as much progress as I wanted. The goal this year is to keep working on it every day and hopefully read a few Yotsuba&! mangas.
* [My current videogame rotation](https://howlongtobeat.com/user/peterfromm): Fortnite (it is amazing how they keep reinventing themselves), Indiana Jones and the Great Circle, The Legend of Zelda: Echoes of Wisdom. Recently, I got an Anbernic RG 40XXV that I want to set up to play oldschool point and click adventure games on the go.

What I’m not doing right now:

* Making music. I'd really love to fit in more music-time in my schedule, but it is a very time-consuming hobby, so it is hard to get started.
* Organizing my music collection using the awesome [Beets](http://beets.io/). I've found a few options to integrate it with Home Assistant and thus indirectly with Google Home. 
* Improving my [Home Assistant](https://www.home-assistant.io/) setup. I have many ideas, but there's just too much to do.
