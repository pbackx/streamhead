Inspired by [Derek Sivers now page](http://sivers.org/now), here’s what I am doing right now (last update September 2019):

* Enjoying family life.
* [Working as a freelancer, helping my clients tame their Data](https://www.linkedin.com/in/pbackx/).
* Slowly creating a backlog for [my new project](https://www.buildastockportfolio.com/)!
* [Reading](https://www.goodreads.com/user/show/37577599-peter-backx). Among others, [the entire Dune saga](http://www.dunenovels.com/). I'm currently about halfway into Heretics of Dune.
* Organizing my music collection using the awesome [Beets](http://beets.io/). I'm a perfectionist, so this is going to take some time.
* [Creating and 3D printing fun stuff](https://www.streamhead.com/category/3d_printing.html).

What I’m not doing right now:

* [Slowly winding down my side business, making sure my customers can find a good new home for their bookkeeping](http://www.streamhead.com/launching-my-first-vaadin-appengine-project/). It SaaS part of the site will officially close on December 31th 2019.
* Building a [voice-controlled](https://aiyprojects.withgoogle.com/voice/) robot. It's still on the back burner.
* Printing 3D printed toys downloaded from Thingiverse. Most of my current projects are adaptations of existing projects. Modelled in either Fusion360 or OpenScad.
