Inspired by [Derek Sivers now page](http://sivers.org/now), here’s what I am doing right now (last update October 2025):

* Building and iterating on [my Lego sorting project](https://www.streamhead.com/3d%20printing/ai/2021/11/01/deep-learning-lego-sorting.html).
* [Reading](https://www.goodreads.com/user/show/37577599-peter-backx). One goal is to read all [Dune novels](http://www.dunenovels.com/). After I have finished the current books I am reading, I will start on the Great Schools trilogy.
* [Learning Japanese, 10 minutes a day](https://www.duolingo.com/profile/PeterBackx1). I wasn't able to make as much progress as I wanted. The goal this year is to keep working on it every day and hopefully read a few Yotsuba&! mangas.
* [My current videogame rotation](https://howlongtobeat.com/user/peterfromm): I am mostly playing Blue Prince right now. If you like games such as Myst, you'll love this one.
* New for this year: I took up golf. Progress is slow, but it is a nice to be outside, even on bad weather days.

What I’m not doing right now:

* I have put [my latest side-project](https://www.savvyfolders.com/) on the backburner for now. I am giving my brain some time to process its current state and consider the next steps.
* Making music. I'd really love to fit in more music-time in my schedule, but it is a very time-consuming hobby, so it is hard to get started.
* Organizing my music collection using the awesome [Beets](http://beets.io/). I've found a few options to integrate it with Home Assistant and thus indirectly with Google Home. 
* Improving my [Home Assistant](https://www.home-assistant.io/) setup. I have many ideas, but there's just too much to do.
