Inspired by [Derek Sivers now page](http://sivers.org/now), here’s what I am doing right now (last update January 2021):

* Enjoying family life, locked down at home due to the great Corona-covid19 thread.
* [Working as a freelancer, helping my clients tame their Data](https://www.linkedin.com/in/pbackx/).
* [Reading](https://www.goodreads.com/user/show/37577599-peter-backx). Among others, [the entire Dune saga](http://www.dunenovels.com/). I'm 20 pages from finishing the last Frank Herbert book (Chapterhouse). I'm a bit disappointed that there are only 2 books chronologically after the one I'm reading now, but I'm also looking forward to learning more about the Butlerian Jihad.
* [Creating and 3D printing useful stuff](https://www.streamhead.com/category/3d_printing.html). Over the years I've had my printer, I see a move away from toys and junk towards useful things, like a case for that Jetson Nano, or custom dividers to clean up the mess in my drawer. I'm also putting some real thought into recycling prints I no longer use. Economically speaking, it makes no sense, but still, I may buy a Felfil or similar in the near future just to figure it all out.
* [Learning Japanese, 10 minutes a day](https://www.duolingo.com/profile/PeterBackx1). It's a slow process, but I feel I'm ready for a next step. Maybe I'll try to read children's books in Hiragana.
* I've also been playing more games lately. Fortnite and Minecraft mostly. I really enjoy the things that the community creates for these games. It's impress how far they can taket hose engines with their creativity.
* And finally, I started with home automation and more specifically [Home Assistant](https://www.home-assistant.io/). Although I'm far from integrating everything "smart" in my home, I already have a few small "wins". One thing I've added is a system to automatically detect when my docking station and connected peripherals are not in use and switch everything off. Saves my about 40 watts that was just lost before. On a yearly basis I estimate about 250kWh less energy usage. And that's on a total of about 3000kWh!

What I’m not doing right now:

* Organizing my music collection using the awesome [Beets](http://beets.io/). I'm a perfectionist, so this is going to take some time.
* Building a [voice-controlled](https://aiyprojects.withgoogle.com/voice/) robot. It's still on the back burner.
* I may revive [my e-book "business"](https://www.amazon.com/How-Make-Videos-YouTube-Free-ebook/dp/B008YY5WXE/), but I'm trying to hold of until I finish a few other things.
